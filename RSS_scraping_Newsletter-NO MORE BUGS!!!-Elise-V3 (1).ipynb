      "['(CNN) Sen. Lindsey Graham and other congressional Republicans have slammed House Democrats for conducting their impeachment inquiry with depositions behind closed doors, but Republicans also used closed-door depositions during their impeachment inquiry of former President Bill Clinton two decades ago.\\n\\nThen-Rep. Lindsey Graham, at a November 1998 news conference one day after Special Prosecutor Ken Starr publicly testified before the House Judiciary Committee, praised the Judiciary panel\\'s plans to hold depositions before conducting public hearings. Graham was a key Republican on the Judiciary Committee and was one of the House impeachment managers during the Senate trial that followed.\\n\\nAsked by a reporter in 1998 if he thought there would be hearings with \"some of the principals,\" Graham said: \"The depositions, I think, will determine whether or not we go forward with hearings. I think it\\'s a very smart thing to do, to depose these people and find out what they\\'ve got to say and not drag this thing out unnecessarily. And it\\'s going to end by the end of the year.\"\\n\\nGraham\\'s comments could provide fodder for Democrats seeking to undercut Republican attacks that the impeachment inquiry should not be conducting depositions behind closed doors, but doing everything in public.\\n\\nThe closed-door depositions are just one of several lines of attack Republicans have leveled, as they\\'re also critical of Democrats for not voting to authorize the impeachment inquiry, the President\\'s counsel not being allowed to participate and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff\\'s handling of the investigation.\\n\\nRead More', '(CNN) Republicans trying to deal with the mushrooming impeachment crisis are asking Donald Trump for something it may be impossible for him ever to deliver: the message discipline of his predecessor Bill Clinton .\\n\\nThey want consistency from a President ready to ignore distractions and dedicated to governing as they seek to impose order on his chaotic impeachment defense. And GOP lawmakers who are being asked to save Trump\\'s presidency also want more structure and coherence from a White House that has always reflected the President\\'s own disorderly and improvisational character.\\n\\nBut, to succeed, this strategy would require Trump to abandon the most dominant traits of his unchained personality and political method -- the qualities that led him to fame and fortune, powered his unlikely political rise and made him America\\'s most unusual President.\\n\\nRepublican senators urged Trump to emulate the example of the former Democratic President during his own impeachment drama in the late 1990s when they met him at the White House on Thursday, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\\n\\nThe idea that Trump, always his own most vehement advocate, would swallow his fury and retreat behind a team of lawyers and professional political spinners is impossible to imagine. After all, he has effectively trashed the communications infrastructure that normal presidents use -- preferring to handle everything himself in wild chats with reporters.\\n\\nAnd the notion that the President would talk about anything other than impeachment and quietly get on with his job of governing — a task for which he has rarely shown much appetite in the first place — also seems fantastical in the extreme.\\n\\nYet that is what Graham, a South Carolina Republican, effectively asked the President to do on Thursday.\\n\\nGraham was asked about the White House\\'s frequently changing impeachment messaging by a reporter Thursday, and quipped \"Have you noticed?\" before going on to praise Clinton -- the man Graham tried to oust from office as a House impeachment manager two decades ago.\\n\\n\"What he did is he had a team that was organized, had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question,\" Graham said.\\n\\n\"And they were on message every day.\"\\n\\nGraham argued that Clinton defended himself but never stopped being President and that was the key to his survival and eventual acquittal in a Senate trial.\\n\\n\"The public may not have liked what the President had done but believed that he was still able to do his job ... I\\'m hoping that will become the model here.\"\\n\\nClinton\\'s approval rating as measured by Gallup stayed high for all of the Monica Lewinsky saga, peaking at 73% in December 1998, the month he was impeached, a level never approached at any time by Trump.\\n\\nIn his book, \"The Clinton Tapes,\" based on contemporaneous conversations with the President, the historian Taylor Branch paraphrased the former commander-in-chief\\'s mindset.\\n\\n\"His best course was to concentrate on his job. He had no higher aspirations for the present, but he thought detachment was the best antidote for cynicism in the long run.\"\\n\\nIt is hard to imagine Trump showing detachment about anything -- let alone an impeachment process he sees as an extension of a radical Deep State conspiracy to eject him from power.\\n\\nTrump cannot abandon what got him to the Oval Office\\n\\nThe President\\'s instinct is always to stoke controversy and outrage that acts not just as a distraction but whips up a storm that forces everyone else off balance as he stands unscathed in its eye.\\n\\nTrump\\'s daily Twitter screeds are not just a sideshow. They are the key to his presidency -- it\\'s how he shapes a political narrative and connects with his army of fervent, loyal voters.\\n\\nAnd the off-the-cuff diversions at campaign rallies are just as important. Since Trump has decided to govern on behalf of his base alone, he needs to keep his supporters in a constant state of outrage that will drive them to the polls next year.\\n\\nTrump also did appear to have success in using his unconventional methods to discredit Robert Mueller and what the President described as his investigating team of \"angry Democrats.\" So it might be hard for anyone to convince him that dumping his belligerent instincts on impeachment represents his best possible strategy.\\n\\nAfter all, his unconventional willingness to stay permanently on the attack and rejecting the guardrails of political correctness is the behavior that makes him appealing to his voters and cements the bedrock of the political base that sustains him.\\n\\nAnd more than that, it\\'s just who Trump is.\\n\\nThe problem for the President is such a political approach may not be well suited to the biggest current challenge before him -- looming impeachment and a likely Senate trial.\\n\\nThe kind of constitutional arguments needed to finesse what appears to be increasingly damning abuses of power in Ukraine are better not communicated via tweet. And they need a coordinated message that has been lacking from the White House.\\n\\n\"They just jump around day to day,\" one GOP aide said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s kind of whatever he tweets out in the morning, that is what they run with.\"\\n\\nThe President\\'s wild attacks on witnesses -- he blasted \"Never Trump Republicans\" this week who criticize him as \"human scum \" -- may also be counterproductive and alienate undecided Americans.\\n\\nAnd the most disastrous moments of Trump\\'s impeachment defense have actually come from the President and top aides who have developed a facility for shooting themselves in the foot.\\n\\nWhile Trump appeared to believe that the r ough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukraine\\'s President was absolving -- and released it -- it actually appeared to show a quid pro quo in which he asked for investigations into 2016 Democrats and Joe Biden in return for military aid.\\n\\nAnd White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney last week appeared to make the President\\'s exposure much worse by saying that such bargains were always part of foreign policy.\\n\\n\"Get over it,\" he said, in a comment that instantly became a centerpiece of the impeachment case against the President.\\n\\nRepublicans take charge of impeachment defense\\n\\nCNN reported on Thursday that Republican lawmakers were taking the reins of the effort to counter the Democratic impeachment push amid frustration at the White House\\'s haphazard approach.\\n\\nTheir move comes at the end of the week in which testimony by the top US diplomat in Ukraine strengthened the case of Democrats who believe there is a case for Trump\\'s removal.\\n\\nThe strategy involves more of an effort to discredit key witnesses and a more confrontational approach to the nuts and bolts of the Democratic inquiry process.\\n\\nTheir switch comes as Democrats begin to strategize on holding open hearings at the end of the current witness deposition stage of the impeachment investigation.\\n\\nThe rival approaches reflect the fact that impeachment is a political process that effectively becomes a battle for the hearts and minds of the American public.\\n\\nRepublicans hope to present the process as partisan and unwarranted and an outrageous attempt to overthrow the results of a democratic election. They also have a new cause to unite behind as of Thursday evening, after it emerged that Attorney General William Barr\\'s investigation into the intelligence and origins of the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign during the 2016 electio n is now a criminal probe.\\n\\nDemocrats want to build a case that Trump abuses his power so egregiously that he should be dismissed from office — and to ultimately convince voters he\\'s unfit for a second term.\\n\\nLike any campaign this requires a strategy, clearly defined goals and a commitment from everyone on the team to spell out the message and avoid diversions that can backfire politically.\\n\\nGraham, who was among senators who spent time with the President at the White House on Thursday, said that the group told Trump to \"keep governing the country.\"\\n\\nAnd he said officials at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue admit that they need help with impeachment messaging.\\n\\n\"I met with Mick Mulvaney. He said, \\'Keep talking to us. We\\'re getting there.\\' Yes, the message has been received and they\\'re making corrective action.\"\\n\\nBut writing a new script is one thing. Getting the President to follow it is a task no one has ever managed before.', \"CNN's Chris Cuomo breaks down Sen. Lindsey Graham's role in the Clinton impeachment, and its stark contrast to his recent comments regarding the impeachment inquiry for President Trump.\", \"The White House is eyeing former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh to lead impeachment messaging efforts, three sources familiar with the discussions said.\\n\\nJared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, is among those pushing for Sayegh's hire, the sources said.

View more opinion on CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Republican lawmakers may have had good reason on Wednesday to barge into a closed-door House Intelligence Committee deposition , delaying the process for five hours, but nevertheless, their stunt was misguided. GOP complaints that partisan House Democrats are holding depositions behind closed doors, and preventing the public from hearing key information from witnesses testifying in the impeachment inquiry to further their own agenda, have some basis in truth -- but that is no excuse for childish antics.\\n\\nThese closed-door testimonies seemed to dredge up many of the same frustrations that Republicans felt after being misled by President Obama\\'s broken promise that every negotiation in the creation of the Affordable Care Act would be done publicly. In the current investigation, some again feel misled about comments from House Intel Chair Adam Schiff, who stated , \"We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower\" whose allegations prompted the impeachment inquiry. It has been revealed that members of his committee did, in fact, speak to the whistleblower before Schiff made this statement. The desire for a transparent process is, therefore, understandable.\\n\\nTo combat the partisanship, Republicans seemingly felt they had to out-childish the Democrats with a stunt. In a year in which Schiff parodied the President\\'s famously controversial call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen made fun of Attorney General Bill Barr, who failed to show up at his House Judiciary Committee hearing, by eating fried chicken , that\\'s hard to do. But let\\'s be clear -- Republicans were not storming the Bastille. Nor was this the \"Brooks Brothers Riot\" of the 2000 presidential election recount in Miami (of which I was a participant), where Republican activists protested over the transparency of the ballot recount.\\n\\nThough Wednesday\\'s political stunt was not violent or physically threatening, Republicans made the mistake of bringing their cell phones, which are not allowed in secure areas like the hearing room for good and obvious reasons. By breaking this rule, these GOP members proactively threw away whatever moral high ground they might have had -- granted, there\\'s not much moral high ground in Washington.\\n\\nWhatabout-ers will call out Republican hypocrisy and say, \"well what about the Benghazi hearings , shouldn\\'t they have been more open?\" The short answer is, yes.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\\n\\nBut that shouldn\\'t excuse the House Democratic Caucus for conducting impeachment inquiry hearings in secret. It\\'s unnecessary and only leads to the juvenile stunts we saw on Wednesday.\\n\\nThere is a better way to hold these hearings -- and that is through the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The Senate committee has not generated the headlines its House counterpart has, and for the right reasons. Its members have kept their heads down through the hard work of seeking to separate fact from fiction -- no small feat in Washington these days.\\n\\nTypically in politics, if you\\'re talking process instead of policy, you\\'re losing. All lawmakers should be focused on the actual allegations surrounding President Trump that prompted the inquiry. Only after seeking the truth can we move on from this investigation.\\n\\nSo why jeopardize that with a stunt?', 'Washington (CNN) The anonymous senior Trump administration official, who previously alleged that there\\'s an internal administration resistance to President Donald Trump, plans to recount the President\\'s conversations in their forthcoming book.\\n\\nAccording to Axios , which first reported that the conversations will be recounted in the book, the anonymous official was a frequent participant in meetings with the President and had access to internal notes they plan to include in their new book on Trump, \"A Warning.\"\\n\\n\"In these pages, you will not just hear from me.

The filing cites emails and calendar entries to back up the claim.\\n\\nTrump has denied assaulting Zervos.\\n\\nWang notes that Zervos reported Trump\\'s alleged sexual assaults to family members and close friends immediately after they occurred and then again over the years and considered taking legal action years before.\\n\\nShe also \"reached out to multiple lawyers back in 2011, including to Gloria Allred, whose records reflect that contact,\" Wang writes. Allred represented Zervos at the time of her October 2016 news conference at which she first accused Trump of sexual assault, but later stepped away from the case.\\n\\nThe filing includes an email to Fox News dated August 9, 2015. In it, Zervos writes Trump acted inappropriately towards her.\\n\\n\"I was on the Apprentice. After the show was completed, Trump invited me to a hotel room under the guise of working for him. He had a different agenda. Please contact me to speak further as I have tried to make contact,\" the email states, under the subject line \"Trump Hit On Me.\"\\n\\nWang also argues that Zervos\\' account has been corroborated \"in close detail\" by documents produced from Trump\\'s own files during the discovery process -- specifically calendar entries and itineraries from late 2007 through early 2008 -- the period during which Zervos says she met with and was assaulted by Trump. Wang says these documents \"line up with Zervos\\' detailed public account with striking accuracy.\"\\n\\nFor instance, Wang says Trump\\'s calendar shows him flying from Las Vegas to Los Angeles with his bodyguard Keith Schiller and staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles on December 21, 2007 -- the same night Zervos says she met him there.\\n\\nZervos also points to emails exchanged with Trump\\'s assistant Rhona Graff regarding a visit she made to New York and a hard copy of a New York Times from December 2007 that she says Trump gave her, as evidence of their interactions.\\n\\nTrump\\'s lawyer rejected Wang\\'s argument in the new filing.\\n\\n\"Ms. Zervos\\' claims are entirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents,\" said Marc Kasowitz, founding partner of Kasowitz Benson Torres LLP.\\n\\nOngoing discovery dispute\\n\\nWang argues that despite Trump\\'s claims that there was \"no truth\" to Zervos\\' allegations, \"he has now been forced to produce documents from his own files confirming that he and Plaintiff were exactly where she said they were exactly when she said they were there.\"\\n\\nThe Trump Organization previously declared these documents \"confidential\" and only after months of legal wrangling and a recent telephone conference with the court did Trump and the Trump Organization \"finally and begrudgingly agreed to lift a number of these baseless designations,\" according to the filing.\\n\\nThe two sides are now in a dispute over additional documents. Wang says the Trump Organization has improperly designated nine pages of records as \"confidential\" because they contain the President\\'s former cell phone number.\\n\\n\"That argument is nothing short of absurd given that Defendant no longer uses that number and, indeed, himself publicized it to his millions of Twitter followers during the 2016 campaign,\" the filing states.\\n\\nWang believes the documents the Trump team is withholding will corroborate Zervos\\' account \"with even more granularity and with a degree of precision that plaintiff could not have known were she not telling the truth.\" However, Wang\\'s elaboration in the subsequent paragraphs is redacted, given the current dispute over confidentiality.', \"(CNN) Attorney General William Barr's probe into the intelligence and origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation is now a criminal investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\nThe so-called investigation of the investigators is led by John Durham, a Connecticut-based federal prosecutor, who so far has conducted some interviews but also has run into some obstacles from witnesses who have declined voluntary interviews, CNN reported last week\\n\\nThe move to make it a criminal inquiry was always anticipated, and it allows Durham to use subpoenas to compel testimony and comes as President Donald Trump faces an onslaught of negative headlines stemming from the House impeachment inquiry into his dealings with Ukraine.

View more opinion at CNN.\\n\\n(CNN) Hello, Mr. President. I\\'m one of the people you\\'ve called \" human scum \" and I\\'m hoping we can all clean up our rhetoric .\\n\\nYou probably don\\'t know me, but a number of your aides and close supporters have known me personally for decades as a Republican ally.\\n\\nAs an original \"NeverTrumper\" cited numerous times by major media for opposing you during the 2016 primary season, I may not be somebody you even care to know. But let me introduce myself anyway. Maybe you, in return, can reintroduce yourself to the American public as someone with some empathy, someone not always in attack mode, someone interested in unity rather than division.\\n\\nI introduce myself not to hold myself up as a paragon, but to provide one example to humanize those you call scum. Others whom I know or have known as NeverTrumpers include some of the finest human beings anyone will ever meet -- thoughtful, faithful, patriotic and generous.\\n\\nI learned the importance of fair process and finding good in others from my late father , a pioneer in the conservative movement beginning some 60 years ago. He was at the famous Sharon Conference at the Buckley family estate in 1960, was a key Reagan chairman in Louisiana, a 25-year member of the Republican State Central Committee there, and the state\\'s Republican National Committeeman for more than four years. He was president of the New Orleans Bar Association, and a noted local spokesman on legal ethics.\\n\\nI was a Reagan White House appointee to the Veterans Administration , a Louisiana Young Republican state chairman , at least a semi-prominent leader in the effort to block neo-Nazi David Duke\\'s rapid political rise in 1989-91, a leadership staffer during the \"Gingrich Revolution,\" and I have been a conservative columnist in good stead for more than 20 years.\\n\\nIn sum, for two generations the Hillyers have worked in the trenches for the things your conservative allies value most. Meanwhile, as I\\'m sure many other original NeverTrumpers have, I also have spent my whole adult life deeply involved in volunteering for church, charity, civic organizations, and community projects. When I believe in certain principles, I act sincerely on those beliefs. Likewise, when I write as a columnist opposing your behaviors, your violations of small-\\'r\\' republican norms, or your policy stances on spending, trade, foreign affairs , ethics, or expanded executive authority , I try to call on those wells of conservatism and community, and to build my contentions on verifiable facts.\\n\\nAnd, again, I\\'d truly rather be praising my president, which is why I try so hard to do so despite my distaste for most of your style and substance. Likewise, I try repeatedly to find common ground with those on the left side of the political aisle -- eagerly hoping that good will combined with American commonalities can unite us all in a sense of shared purpose\\n\\nI certainly have flaws, but I know I\\'m not scum. I don\\'t think very highly of you, Mr. President, but I don\\'t think you\\'re human scum, either.\\n\\nMore than that, I hear in my memory the voices of fellow NeverTrumpers on lengthy phone calls in 2016, voices of people who also have spent decades working honorably and avidly for conservative policies and solutions. They were voices of people motivated not by personal gain (I know not a single one who profited from opposing you) but by love of country and real concern that your brand of politics represents a perilous path for the America they treasure.\\n\\nYou may resent that they still feel that way about you -- but you must admit you invite, indeed provoke, such reactions. You do it aggressively. You hurl insults almost indiscriminately, attack when you could be welcoming new allies, divide even when there\\'s no need to conquer. If you stop doing those things, then these good, kind people who are neither dangerous nor scum might draw on their own wells of experience and grace, and enlist with you in some common cause.\\n\\nI assume those other NeverTrumpers feel as I do that your generic insult is not occasion for strong offense or even hurt feelings. What\\'s painful is not that you said it about us, but that any president besmirched the office we revere as the symbol of a great and good nation, by saying any such thing about fellow Americans merely for exercising their rights as citizens. It grieves us to see the presidency abased.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter.

The attack by Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier stunned the nation -- especially after it emerged that they targeted her due to their fixation on \"Slender Man,\" an internet boogeyman\\n\\nIn a deal with prosecutors, Geyser pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder and got 40 years in a mental institution instead of serving jail time. Weier pleaded guilty to attempted second-degree homicide due to mental illness and a judge sentenced her to 25 years in a mental health facility\\n\\nIn an exclusive interview with ABC\\'s \"20/20\" set to air Friday, Leutner, who\\'s now 17, said the attack traumatized her physically and emotionally, and she sleeps with a pair of broken scissors. She said she finds it hard to make new friends because she cannot trust people easily.\\n\\n\"She has friends, but initially, even with those friends, she kept them at arm\\'s length,\" her mother, Stacie Leutner, told ABC. \"And for a long time, even trusting family members was hard for her.\"\\n\\nCNN does not typically name minors charged with crimes, but makes exceptions if they are charged as an adult, as were Geyser and Weier.\\n\\nThe night before the attack\\n\\nIn May 2014, the trio had gone to Geyser\\'s home for a slumber party to celebrate her birthday.\\n\\nIt was a regular day for them -- they\\'d previously spent a lot of time together playing outside, drawing and having sleepovers, Leutner said. During those times, Geyser constantly talked about Slender Man, a character that terrified Leutner, she said.\\n\\nSo much so, Leutner asked her mother if Slender Man was real and she reassured her that he was not. Slender Man -- a menacing, faceless specter in a dark suit, sometimes portrayed with octopus-like tentacles -- is said to haunt children and lurks in the darkest corners of the Web. The internet monster was created in an online forum for people who enjoy creating fake supernatural images.\\n\\n\"I thought it was odd. It kind of frightened me a little bit,\" Leutner told ABC of her friends\\' fascination with the character. \"But I went along with it. I was supportive because I thought that\\'s what she liked.\"\\n\\nAs the friendship between Geyser and Weier grew, so did the pair\\'s fixation with Slender Man, Leutner said.\\n\\nThe birthday party\\n\\nWhile she didn\\'t know her friend planned to harm her after they celebrated Geyser\\'s 12th birthday at a local roller rink followed by a slumber party, something felt off that night in retrospect, she said.\\n\\n\"At all of our past sleepovers, [Geyser] always wanted to stay up all night because she could never do that at home,\" Leutner said. \"But on [the night of] the birthday party, she wanted to go to bed.\"\\n\\nHer friends later told investigators that they had planned to kill Leutner in her sleep that night but then decided to do it the next morning at a nearby park.\\n\\nWhen she woke up, they were downstairs on the computer so she joined them for doughnuts before heading to the park. While there, they told her the plan was to play hide-and-seek and asked her to lie down under the leaves and sticks as part of the game, she said.\\n\\n\"But it was really just a trick to get me down there,\" she said.\\n\\nThat\\'s when Geyser repeatedly stabbed her with a kitchen knife and the girls left her alone in the woods, bleeding and struggling get help.\\n\\nAfter she crawled out of the woods, a passing bicyclist found her and called 911.', \"Attorney General William Barr's probe into the intelligence and origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation is now a criminal investigation, according to a person familiar with the matter.\", 'New York (CNN Business) Every Halloween Chipotle celebrates the holiday with discounts for customers who buy their meals while in costume, a 19-year-old promotion it calls \"Boorito.\"\\n\\nThis year, the company is updating the promotion by partnering with video sharing app TikTok, encouraging users to post videos of themselves in their Halloween finery while using the hashtag #Boorito.

He was a magnetic son and brother and friend. If you met him you knew him, you remembered him. His smile, his laugh, the encouragement he offered with words or even without. He had an untamable grand personality and dreams to match. And he hated being put in a box.\\n\\nHe expressed himself through the music he made. And by made I mean, written, recorded, produced, mixed, and designed the art. All of it. A true artist. His first show was a week ago, and it was nothing short of electric. Everyone felt it, everyone knew it. He could\\'ve easily taken the easy route and put music out when he was 12, 14, 16, even 18, but he always said he wanted to live some life and have something to say before he did it. He didn\\'t want to be a child star, he wanted to be a man with scars and a story to tell. I always admired, respected and encouraged that stand.\\n\\nTruett always had a soft spot for God. The Bible moved him. His heart was warm to the things of his King. He was by no means a cookie cutter Christian but give me a believer who fights to keep believing. Give me a broken man who recognizes his need for a Savior every time. That\\'s who Truett was and how he should be remembered.\\n\\nMy last moment with Truett in person was at his first show this past Thursday at the Factory in Franklin, Tennessee. I had to leave the next morning very early to fly and start our Canadian tour. As I stood in the audience and watched my son bring joy to a room, I was as proud as a \"pop\" (as tru called me) could be. It was the culminating moment of a dream that he had since he was 12.

With more than $10 billion in sales in 2018, the company has surpassed both Wendy\\'s and Burger King to become the fifth largest fast food chain after McDonald\\'s, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell.\\n\\n\"If you have the biggest share of a growing category, that is profits galore,\" said Michael Haracz, who until August served as McDonald\\'s manager of culinary innovation. \"That is exponentially more sales, more buzz, more foot traffic to your restaurant.\"\\n\\nMcDonald\\'s, which says it is \"synonymous with burgers,\" has reason to worry: Beef consumption has fallen in the United States. Chicken is now the most popular meat by far.\\n\\nThere will be \"clear winners,\" Haracz said, who will dominate the space and scoop up profits — as long as they can keep up with demand.\\n\\nThirty-year food fight\\n\\nThough the fight over fried chicken was especially buzzy this summer, it was part of a dynamic that dates back at least 30 years.\\n\\nIn 1989 McDonald\\'s launched a national \"country-style\" McChicken sandwich and sparked a fight with Hardee\\'s, then one of the largest fast food chains in the country. \"While McDonald`s is touting their new product, it isn\\'t even comparable to our Chicken Fillet Sandwich, which has been on the market since 1979,\" Hardee\\'s president said at the time, according to a 1989 report from the Charlotte Observer. The newspaper published the story with the headline, \"Chicken sandwiches incite fast food war.\"\\n\\nOver the ensuing decades, fast food chains have launched and relaunched new iterations of the sandwich. McDonald\\'s has had multiple versions, including premium and limited-time offerings. Within the last year alone, it\\'s served the Ultimate Chicken Sandwich, the Mighty Chicken Sandwich, a spicy BBQ chicken sandwich and the McChicken.\\n\\nAs companies experimented with chicken sandwiches, they occasionally caused a stir. In 2010, KFC made headlines with the Double Down — a limited-time-only cheese and bacon sandwich with two pieces of fried chicken where the bun should have been. (KFC briefly brought it back in 2014 .)\\n\\nBut even though items like the Double Down have gone viral, there may not have been anything quite like the frenzy that happened this summer, when Popeyes launched its national chicken sandwich.\\n\\nPeople stood in line for hours for a chance to taste (and post photos of) the sandwich. Workers reportedly put in grueling hours as store operators scrambled to keep up with the surge in impatient customers.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t that Popeyes wasn\\'t expecting the sandwich to be a hit. It painstakingly researched what would work with customers, and eventually landed on the right combination — a buttermilk battered and breaded white meat filet, topped with pickles and a choice of mayo or a spicy Cajun spread and served on a toasted brioche bun. Popeyes called the sandwich the \"biggest product launch in the last 30 years.\" Felipe Athayde, president of the Americas at Popeyes, told the New York Times that the company had \"very aggressively forecasted\" demand , and expected to have sufficient supply through at least the end of September — about six weeks after its August 12 launch date. But stores throughout the country sold out of the sandwich within about two weeks.\\n\\nMany point to a Twitter exchange as the instigator. On August 19, one week after Popeyes sandwich hit stores, Chick-fil-A\\'s official Twitter account posted a message: \"Bun + Chicken + Pickles = all the <3 for the original.\" Popeyes interpreted the message as a jab, retweeted the post and added \".... y\\'all good?\"\\n\\nThe sassy response struck a nerve. It\\'s racked up nearly 87,000 retweets and 324,000 likes, spawned memes and elicited innumerable cry-laugh emojis from social media users. Chick-fil-A didn\\'t take the bait, but Wendy\\'s stepped in and sparred with Popeyes on Twitter to the delight of onlookers.\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely that the brand war would have made such a huge impact if Americans weren\\'t already interested in fried chicken sandwiches.\\n\\n\"There had always been fried chicken sandwiches,\" said Kara Nielsen, vice president of trends and marketing for CCD Innovation, a food and beverage consultancy. But she traces the current interest in the item to the 2008 financial crisis.\\n\\n\"One of the things that surged out of that recession moment was an interest in comfort food, as well as a lot of people opening food trucks, creating food stalls,\" she said. \"And so there were definitely a lot of fried chicken sandwiches coming out at that time. And it\\'s never really stopped.\"\\n\\nAnd as bespoke fried chicken sandwiches gained local fans, a small, quirky chain was chugging steadily along.\\n\\nThe rise of Chick-fil-A\\n\\nChick-fil-A traces its roots back to founder S. Truett Cathy\\'s original diner, Dwarf Grill, which opened in 1946. Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A in 1967, in the Greenbriar Shopping Center in Atlanta.\\n\\nFor years, the company expanded primarily in shopping mall food courts. Then, in 1986, it opened its first standalone location in Atlanta. Today the chain operates more than 2,400 restaurants in 47 states and Washington, D.C. Other chicken chains are larger — Popeyes, for example, has more than 2,600 US restaurants and KFC has roughly 4,000. But Chick-fil-A outsells them.\\n\\nChick-fil-A\\'s first restaurant in Atlanta\\'s Greenbriar Mall in the late 1960s.\\n\\nRanked by annual revenue, Chick-fil-A is the fifth largest US restaurant chain after McDonald\\'s, Starbucks, Subway and Taco Bell — all of which have far more stores.\\n\\nChick-fil-A\\'s individual stores are more productive than any of its bigger competitors. They pulled in an average of $4.4 million in 2018, well above unit sales at McDonald\\'s or Starbucks, according to Technomic, a company that specializes in research on the food industry.\\n\\nThe chain is also, according to polls and surveys, beloved.\\n\\nAn Axios Harris Poll published in March found that Chick-fil-A had the best reputation among US adults compared to Starbucks, Yum! Brands (which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell), Chipotle, Papa John\\'s and McDonald\\'s. And for the past four years in a row, US teens surveyed by Piper Jaffray said Chick-fil-A was their favorite restaurant.\\n\\nCustomer service and food quality help explain Chick-fil-A\\'s success. But it also has a commercially important X-factor: authenticity.\\n\\nR.J. Hottovy, an analyst who covers food for Morningstar, said that in recent years, companies that have specialized in a particular product and appear more authentic tend to do better than those that try to appeal to everyone.\\n\\nChick-fil-A scores high on authenticity. It has stuck to Christian roots by keeping stores closed on Sundays, for example. But that conservative tradition has also earned backlash. In 2012 CEO Dan Cathy said he opposed gay marriage on religious grounds . That year the company was also criticized for donations made by the WinShape Foundation , which was started by founder Truett Cathy and financed largely by Chick-fil-A profits, to groups some characterized as anti-gay.\\n\\nChick-fil-A says that is has \"no political or social agenda,\" and that \"everyone is welcome in our restaurants.\" Still, new stores have been met with protests . Some fans of fried chicken sandwiches may welcome an offering from a purveyor they see as more politically neutral, like Popeyes.\\n\\nNevertheless, Chick-fil-A has grown at a steady clip and picked up those devoted followers.\\n\\n\"There\\'s so many people now who have an understanding or a notion of what Chick-fil-A is, even if they never eat there or if they\\'ve never seen one,\" Nielsen noted. \"It\\'s become a bit of this mythical thing, and clearly millennials have found it, and found that it fits their bill.\"\\n\\nAs Chick-fil-A locations pop up in more cities, more people rush to test out their sandwiches. That\\'s helped boost fried chicken sandwich sales — and gotten other fast food chains to pay attention. \"This fried chicken trend keeps evolving because companies like Chick-fil-A expand their reach,\" Nielsen said.\\n\\nWhile Chick-fil-A creeps across the nation, one group in particular is trying to defend its territory. McDonald\\'s franchise operators are calling for reinforcements.\\n\\nA McMission\\n\\nOn July 10 — a month before Popeyes launched its sandwich — the board of the National Owners Association, a group of McDonald\\'s franchisees that formed in 2018, sent out a strongly-worded letter to its members.\\n\\n\"We are finding ways to drive profitable growth,\" the board wrote. \"Yet, we are still losing guest counts. This continues to be a concern.\"\\n\\nOne reason for the loss, the board argued, is that customers craving a delicious fried chicken sandwich aren\\'t going to McDonald\\'s. They\\'re going to Chick-fil-A.\\n\\n\"A favorite, that our customers want, is a chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, they have to go to Chick-fil-A for it,\" the board said. \"Chick-fil-A\\'s results demonstrate the power of chicken. Yes, we have great Chicken McNuggets and our McChicken is a very good product. But we do not compete in the premium chicken sandwich category, either grilled or crispy.\"\\n\\nThe letter continued with a warning: \"Our US Southeast markets\\' results should concern everyone. You may not have Chick-fil-A\\'s in your market or to the degree they have them in the southeast, but they are coming. And they don\\'t discount.\"\\n\\nMcDonald\\'s knows how to make chicken into a hit. In the early 1980s, around the time Americans first started losing interest in beef, McDonald\\'s founder Ray Kroc wanted to add a chicken entree to the menu. The company\\'s initial attempts, like a deep fried chicken pot pie, didn\\'t resonate with customers. But eventually, McDonald\\'s landed on a winner: Chicken McNuggets, which launched in 1983, were so successful that by 1985 the chain had become the second-largest chicken seller in the fast food space behind KFC.\\n\\n\"Chicken has been on the radar for quite a while at McDonald\\'s,\" Haracz said. \"There\\'s a variety of chicken sandwiches being tested.\"\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2019, traffic at US McDonald\\'s restaurants was down . During an October call discussing the earnings, one analyst wondered whether McDonald\\'s lost sales because it sat out the great chicken sandwich war.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we would go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that\\'s a fair conclusion,\" answered Kevin Ozan, the company\\'s chief financial officer.\\n\\nFor now, McDonald\\'s is keeping its plans close to the vest. The company declined to tell CNN Business when it expects to launch its next chicken sandwich, but noted, \"We are inspired by the customer demand for premium chicken sandwiches, and are working closely with our franchisees to deliver what our customers want. Stay tuned.\"\\n\\nA source close to the conversation between the owners and McDonald\\'s leadership said a premium chicken sandwich may start rolling out as soon as this year.\\n\\nBut while McDonald\\'s tinkers and focuses on other areas of the business, its franchise owners have been getting impatient.\\n\\nIn late August, after Popeyes\\' massively successful launch, Blake Casper, NOA\\'s director, sent out another somber note.\\n\\n\"It was a busy week, especially if you work at Popeyes,\" he wrote. \"Popeyes came out with a chicken sandwich that rivals Chick-fil-A. It\\'s the first time Chick-fil-A has blinked, or more accurately, was forced to blink. But make no mistake, they blinked. Wendy\\'s got into the action and unfortunately, we\\'re still not in the game.\"\\n\\nBut, Casper continued, it\\'s not over yet.\\n\\n\"That is going to change. We are working on a chicken sandwich that will compete. We will be in the game. People will tire of the service at Popeyes and they want an alternative to Chick-fil-A,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They want a chicken sandwich at McDonald\\'s. We are going to give it to them.\"', 'Adweek Creative and Innovation editor David Griner says that \"Black Twitter\" should be credited for making Popeyes\\' chicken sandwich a viral sensation and that the fast-food chain needs to be careful to not be sold out of the sandwiches for too long.', 'New York (CNN Business) Costco is willing to go to extreme lengths to keep its prized rotisserie chickens at $4.99.\\n\\nFor the past few years, it\\'s been recruiting farmers in Nebraska and recently opened a sprawling, $450 million poultry complex of its very own in Nebraska.\\n\\nsold 91 million rotisserie chickens last year, more than double the number from a decade prior.\\n\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about Costco\\'s cheap chicken strategy:\\n\\n1. Costco locates rotisserie chickens at the back of stores\\n\\nFor Costco, the chickens are a lure, pulling customers into stores and getting them to browse the aisles, adding sometimes hundreds of dollars worth of items to their shopping carts before they pick up that bird.\\n\\nPricing chickens at $4.99 is one of the ways Costco hooks warehouse club members and convinces them to pony up each year for a membership.\\n\\n2. Costco has sold rotisserie chickens at $4.99 since 2009\\n\\nCostco is so determined to keep its rotisserie chickens at $4.99 that it\\'s been willing to lose money selling them in the past. Even as competitors increased their rotisserie chickens to $5.99 in recent years, Costco held its price steady.\\n\\n\"As prices changed dramatically and we saw the competition raising the price, it was a hot price,\" Costco\\'s chief financial officer Richard Galanti said in 2014.\\n\\nCostco sold 91 million rotisserie chickens last year\\n\\nCostco was willing to sacrifice \"$30 million, $40 million a year on gross margin by keeping it at $4.99,\" Galanti said the following year. \"That is what we do for a living.\"\\n\\n3. Costco has been having challenges finding birds weighing six pounds\\n\\nAmericans are eating more chicken than ever before and bird weights are climbing to keep up with demand.\\n\\n\"We were having trouble getting the size bird we wanted on a consistent basis,\" said Jeff Lyons, senior vice president of fresh foods at Costco. \"We couldn\\'t take a seven-pound bird or an eight-pound bird and make it work. They\\'re too big. They wouldn\\'t even fit on our rotisserie line.\"\\n\\nTyson TSN Pilgrim\\'s Pride PPC Traditional chicken suppliers likeandare also producing fewer birds to be sold as rotisserie chickens.\\n\\nAn estimated 15% of chickens today are sold as whole birds, down from around 50% of all poultry in the 1980s, according to the Department of Agriculture.\\n\\nThat\\'s why Costco is seizing control of its chicken supply chain. Costco believes it can slash costs by bringing production in house, saving up to 35 cents per bird.\\n\\n4. Costco will control the production process in Nebraska from farm to store\\n\\nThe retailer is building a poultry complex in Fremont, Nebraska, a farming town near the Iowa border. The complex includes a processing facility, hatchery and feed mill.\\n\\nCostco picked Nebraska for the poultry plant because the area had grain, water and labor available. Those are the three biggest costs involved with chicken production.\\n\\nCostco\\'s nearly 400,000 square-foot processing plant in Fremont, Nebraska, will eventually employ 950 workers.\\n\\nThe nearly 400,000 square-foot plant in Fremont will employ 950 workers. The plant will take 45 weeks to ramp up to full production. Once it\\'s at full speed, the plant will process about 100 million chickens a year, or 40% of Costco\\'s annual chicken needs. Costco will process around two million birds a week in Nebraska to supply to stores on the West Coast.\\n\\nCostco will control the production process from farm to store, making key decisions down to the grain chickens eat and the type of eggs hatched.\\n\\n5. There\\'s been backlash in Nebraska to Costco\\'s operations\\n\\nCostco has put its socially-conscious corporate reputation on the line, fending off local critics who have rallied against the Nebraska operation.\\n\\nIts poultry farm ambitions have sparked backlash among environmentalists and farmers\\' advocates in the Fremont area.\\n\\nOpponents of the plant in Fremont like Randy Ruppert, a local activist, worry about the environmental impact of the plant and poultry barns, such as water contamination from runoff, ammonia from chicken feces and other health risks.', \"(CNN) In case you missed it, America has been kind of obsessed with chicken sandwiches lately.

The app signed 10 million new users within a month of the cash ban, going from adding tens of thousands of people a day to around half a million.\\n\\nThe cash ban \"made us a folklore name in this country,\" Sharma said. And while its rate of growth is no longer as rapid as it was back then, Paytm has more than doubled its user base in the last two and a half years to 400 million.\\n\\nPaytm\\'s growth is reflected in digital payments overall as well. The average number of cashless payments per person per year in India has gone from 2.4 to 22.4 in the last five years, according to a report commissioned by the country\\'s central bank published in May.\\n\\nBut cash still rules. Despite the growth of digital payments, the value of currency in circulation increased by 17% to more than 21 trillion rupees ($296 billion) in the past financial year, according to the central bank. That\\'s around ten times the value of mobile payment transactions over the same period.\\n\\n\"India remains a largely cash-driven economy. Economic growth has been possible through many transactions that are done primarily in cash,\" the report said.\\n\\n\"The biggest challenge that we face comes from customers\\' ability or intent to pay digitally,\" Sharma said. \"Paytm and the mobile payment has taken off, but still there is a huge amount of resistance.\"\\n\\nDriven by ambition\\n\\nSharma grew up in Aligarh, a small town about 100 miles south of India\\'s capital, New Delhi. He finished high school by the time he was 14 and graduated from the Delhi College of Engineering at age 19, according to a blog post on Paytm\\'s website.\\n\\nBut Sharma didn\\'t speak much English and struggled to understand what was being taught in class. He got through college by reading two versions of the textbooks — one in English and the other in his native Hindi. He would also spend a lot of time in the college computer lab, according to the blog post, \"browsing the internet and dreaming about being in Silicon Valley.\"\\n\\nBy the time he graduated, Sharma had taught himself to code and already had his first startup under his belt. He cofounded a company called XS Communications that made content management systems used by several major Indian publications. The company was sold to a US entrepreneur for $1 million in 1999.\\n\\nHe spent the next year trying to set up One97, taking on significant debt that he paid off by doing odd jobs like setting up internet connections for paying customers. It would take nearly two decades for him to become one of India\\'s youngest billionaires and a household name in the country. To many Indians, he is the recognizable face of the digital payments company he founded. ( Forbes has his net worth at $2.4 billion.)\\n\\n\"Vijay is the heart and soul of Paytm.

PhonePe, owned by Walmart, has 150 million users. Amazon also has its own digital payment platform, Amazon Pay, and added person-to-person digital payments earlier this year.\\n\\nAnd an even bigger rival is waiting in the wings.

Launched in 2017, it\\'s aimed at cashing in on India\\'s online retail market, which Morgan Stanley forecasts will be worth $200 billion by 2027.\\n\\nBut while Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have taken over the market and disrupted India\\'s millions of smaller retailers, Paytm Mall has failed to make much of an inroad. The platform has a little over 3% of the Indian market, compared to more than 30% each for Amazon and Flipkart.\\n\\nThere are other potential hurdles as well: New Indian regulations requiring digital payment firms to do more background checks on their consumers could drastically increase costs. Heavy regulations govern Paytm\\'s other businesses, including banking, loans and insurance. One97 is also racking up losses — its total loss in the financial year that ended in March 2019 was nearly 40 billion rupees ($560 million), a 165% increase from the previous year, according to multiple media reports . It also reportedly has around $96 million in debt.\\n\\n\"We have invested more in consumer and merchant growth,\" a company spokesperson said, adding that it aims to reduce losses by \"more than 25%\" this year.\\n\\nBut Sharma is confident he can make it all work.

Last week, for instance, it was revealed that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella got a 66% raise, bringing his total compensation to nearly $43 million. And this summer Abigail Disney, an heir to the Disney fortune, publicly criticized CEO Bob Iger\\'s $66 million pay package, which is more than 1,000 times the median pay of Disney employees.\\n\\nWhile many CEOs are not as generously compensated as Nadella and Iger, they do pretty well.\\n\\nIn 2018, the median total compensation for S&P 500 CEOs rose 4% to $12.3 million, according to the latest figures from the Conference Board. CEOs at the high end of that group were paid more than $22 million , while those at the low end were paid roughly $6 million.\\n\\nBut why do they make so much? And why might one CEO make millions more than another?\\n\\nOne major consideration that goes into how much a CEO should be paid is what other companies are paying. Compensation committees benchmark CEO pay against a self-selected peer group -- often 12 to 20 companies that may be of similar size and complexity, and have similar business models, according to Robin Ferracone, CEO of Farient Advisors, an executive compensation consulting firm.\\n\\nBoards will also consider whether a candidate would be a first-time CEO, who will typically be paid at the lower end of the scale.\\n\\nIf the chosen candidate is forfeiting still-unvested stock awards at her current employer, the board may offer a one-time \"make-whole\" pay award to compensate for that loss on top of her normal compensation.\\n\\nThat\\'s partly why internal candidates are usually less expensive than outsiders. \"You\\'re starting them out at the low end of the market range. It\\'s a big step up for them but fairly priced for someone with no CEO experience,\" Ferracone said. \"And you don\\'t have the make-whole pay awards. They\\'re already at the company. They\\'re not walking away.\"\\n\\nPlus, boards looking outside for a CEO will want a proven commodity and that will cost them more because an experienced CEO will want to be paid above the average, said David Swinford, CEO of executive compensation consulting firm Pearl Meyer.\\n\\nTying pay to performance\\n\\nCEO compensation packages typically include a base salary, a bonus plan, two types of long-term incentives, plus perks and benefits, Ferracone said.\\n\\nWith investors demanding that pay be tied more closely to performance, an increasing share of CEO compensation is in company stock, especially in bonuses and long-term incentive plans. For the first time last year, stock awards accounted for more than 50% of S&P 500 CEOs\\' total median compensation, the Conference Board found.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s MSFT Disney\\'s DIS In the case ofNadella, the majority of his $43 million pay package comes from stock awards. The same was true forIger. Similarly, last year nearly $37 million of the $50 million pay package that now former 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch received was in stock awards, according to the Conference Board.\\n\\nBut stock awards have strings attached. Payment typically depends on whether a CEO hits certain targets, which are primarily financial -- for instance, an earnings target or a return on capital investment. There may be some non-financial targets, too, such as increasing diversity among the ranks or reaching certain safety goals. For example, Chuck Jones, who has been CEO of the utility company First Energy since 2015, has to meet safety and diversity goals to receive his full bonus potential, Ferracone said.\\n\\nStock awards come in several flavors, including restricted stocks and performance shares. Each have their own set of rules and vesting schedules and each differ in how directly they\\'re tied to performance.\\n\\nSay a board wants to award the CEO $100,000 in stock-based compensation and the company\\'s stock is trading at $100 a share. The executive may get 1,000 shares of restricted stock, a third of which will vest each year for three years. If the company -- and by extension its stock price -- do well under the CEO, his pay from that award will be greater than $100,000.\\n\\nIf instead the CEO is awarded 1,000 performance shares, he will need to meet a given target over time -- for instance, an average return on investment over the next three years — to get the full payout. If only part of the target is met, he may get a partial payout, Swinford said.\\n\\nIn either case, the $100,000 is what gets counted as part of the CEO\\'s compensation the year it\\'s awarded, even though he may end up getting much more or less depending on where the share price is when the award vests. So a CEO\\'s published compensation number for a given year often is not a true reflection of what he takes home that year or what he\\'ll eventually be paid.\\n\\nAre CEOs paid too much?\\n\\non CEO compensation under the SEC\\'s rule. The vote results are not binding, so don\\'t require the board to take action. But they do let boards know how shareholders feel about the issue. The rule has only been in effect for 8 years. But so far this year, investors have rejected only 2.5% of pay package proposals, and the rate was similarly low last year, according to David Kokell, director of US compensation research for Most big public companies are now required to provide shareholders with a voteon CEO compensation under the SEC\\'s Say-on-Pay rule. The vote results are not binding, so don\\'t require the board to take action. But they do let boards know how shareholders feel about the issue. The rule has only been in effect for 8 years. But so far this year,investors have rejected only 2.5% of pay package proposals, and the rate was similarly low last year, according to David Kokell, director of US compensation research for Institutional Shareholder Services\\n\\nSince the Say-on-Pay rule went into effect, CEO pay has actually risen. Still, Kokell said, \"[the rule] has likely slowed the growth of pay. And it certainly has had a dramatic impact on the composition of top executive pay -- resulting in widescale shifts to performance-conditioned pay opportunities.\"\\n\\nEven with that shift, though, it still can be hard to decipher just how well CEO pay is aligned with performance and shareholder value. CEO compensation packages have so many moving parts that pay out over time. And different corporate actions, such as stock buybacks , or the use of different accounting methods, can change the very targets that CEOs are supposed to hit under their pay incentive plans.\\n\\nFerracone notes that attractive CEO candidates will be doing pay comparisons of their own before accepting a position. \"It\\'s a competitive market. CEOs will work for the company that pays them fairly for the job they\\'re doing. They\\'re no different than anyone else in that regard.\"\\n\\nAnd when boards increase CEO pay at some companies, that can drive other companies to pay more because their peer group norms go up.\\n\\nSky-high compensation packages often drive critics to ask: Are CEOs really worth all the money they\\'re paid?\\n\\n\"Don\\'t confuse pay with what people are worth. No human being is worth $20 million, but many executives cost $20 million,\" said Swinford.', 'Johnita P.

Sadly, time and time again, the fact that someone is the victim of discrimination or worse — violence — hasn\\'t been enough. In fact, many victims have been discredited in the media as part of defense strategies while the perpetrators of the violence have been elevated to sympathetic status.\\n\\nBut in the case of police or state violence and practices, we must be careful not to limit our outrage or attention to the killings of only the seemingly \"perfect\" victims.\\n\\nAn analysis of a US Police Shooting Database of data from 2011-2014, the year Michael Brown was killed, showed that the probability of being shot by police was about 3.49 times more likely for unarmed African-Americans compared to unarmed white Americans.

He has focused on a theory about the Black Plague. His theory is that as whites saw entire populations throughout Europe wiped out from the disease that caused their skin to blacken from necrosis or gangrene, they were traumatized and ultimately associated dark skin with the disease they feared.

To me, it represents a clear yearning to find the root cause of this epidemic of fatal bias in policing — based on one\\'s skin color — so that it can be treated and cured . The socio-political consequences of the Black Plague theory as well as more traditional social identity theory which holds that humans are innately tribal and elevate those who are similar and denigrate those who are different are the same: When denigration has the power, authority and resources of law enforcement behind it, it becomes deadly.\\n\\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\\'s new newsletter.

Watching Trump drive a stake through the heart of this treaty should be quite a pleasant prospect for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nThough President Dwight Eisenhower first proposed such a treaty in 1955, it did not become a reality until 2002. Since then, the Open Skies Treaty has allowed reconnaissance flights over each of the 34 nations that have signed it -- largely NATO nations and others across eastern Europe. This arrangement has allowed American surveillance aircraft to keep track of just what the Russian military is up to in areas like eastern Ukraine, or in Georgia, where Russian troops once tried in vain to seize large swaths of territory.\\n\\nAn American withdrawal from the Open Skies treaty would give Putin more leeway to make forays into areas like eastern Ukraine, where he\\'d love to keep his actions concealed from western scrutiny. As Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, Chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, wrote in a letter to National Security Adviser Robert O\\'Brien, \"Withdrawal risks dividing the transatlantic alliance and would further undermine America\\'s reliability as a stable and predictable partner when it comes to European security.\"\\n\\nBy withdrawing from the Open Skies treaty, the United States would fulfill Putin\\'s goals by effectively \"driving another wedge into the NATO alliance,\" Reif says. President Barack Obama\\'s deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes may have put it best in a recent tweet : \"Sometimes the only way to explain/predict Trump\\'s foreign policy is to think \\'what would Putin want the US to do?\\'\"\\n\\nEach time Donald Trump has withdrawn from an international treaty, I\\'ve declared it his single most cataclysmic move. And each time, he has surprised me by topping his previous actions. He certainly surprised me with the audacity of his decision in 2017 to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and with his utter failure to understand what the consequences would be. Trump followed this move in 2018 by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear accord, to similarly disastrous consequences. Then there was Trump\\'s withdrawal from the INF (intermediate nuclear forces) agreement this August, touching off what will inevitably be a new arms race , and certainly freeing up Russia\\'s ability to test and deploy new generations of advanced missiles threatening America\\'s allies in western Europe.\\n\\nNow, the administration is threatening to withdraw from the Treaty on Open Skies.\\n\\n\"The view within DOD and the State Department is that there continues to be significant value here to the United States and to our allies and partners\" in maintaining the treaty, Kingston Reif, director for Disarmament and Threat Reduction Policy at the Arms Control Association, tells me in an interview.\\n\\nWith this treaty in force, Reif says, \"The United States has been able to fly over Ukraine and western Russia. These flights have yielded valuable data with respect to the Russian military.\" Moreover, since Ukraine is also a signatory to the pact, its military has benefited from intelligence gleaned from these overflights, Reif tells me.\\n\\nThe Open Skies treaty allowed one particularly important flight over eastern Ukraine on December 6, 2018, after Russians attacked Ukrainian naval vessels in the Black Sea. The flight , which included American, Canadian, French, German, Romanian, British and Ukrainian observers on board the OC-135 surveillance plane, \"reaffirm(ed) (the) United States\\' commitment to Ukraine and other partner nations,\" a Defense Department statement said. While the United States does have other sources of satellite surveillance, this particular flight was crucial: It produced images that could be broadly released because they were obtained from this less-classified source. Our ability to make and disseminate these images demonstrated to Russia that the world was watching.\\n\\nThe treaty has also allowed surveillance flights over the heavily armed Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, where the Kremlin has been upgrading its nuclear weapons storage and deployment. These flights have been particularly useful to the Baltic members of NATO, including neighboring Lithuania , where advanced Russian systems pose an immediate and ever-present threat.\\n\\nTo get a sense of the shock and horror Trump\\'s withdrawal has elicited from America\\'s strategic establishment, look no further than the United States Strategic Command\\'s (Stratcom) Twitter account. It quietly asserted its support for the Open Skies Treaty by retweeting Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who wrote that the agreement \"helps build confidence & increase transparency.\"\\n\\nIt remains unclear why the Trump administration is looking to pull out of the treaty after 17 years. The administration has declined to comment to CNN, or to me, on the cause or the timing of the withdrawal.\\n\\nRegardless, the treaty offers several critical functions.

She searched online for information about the detentions, but couldn\\'t find anything that explained what was going on. She then filed a series of public records requests with officials at the juvenile detention center closest to her, hoping they could shed light on what ICE was doing and why these minors were being held in places run more like jails than the shelters most migrant children end up in when they are detained. She had specifically requested detailed detainee files, with names and personal information redacted, and the facility was ready to share them with her.\\n\\nBut what happened next stunned her: ICE blocked the facility from sharing the records and the federal government even went to court to keep the information secret.\\n\\nUnbeknownst to Godoy, she had stumbled upon an obscure pocket of the immigration system, where little is known, and little is divulged.\\n\\nFor more than a decade, ICE has been taking a small number of immigrant teens it deems to be dangerous far from their families and detaining them for months at a time.\\n\\nFor immigration attorneys and human rights experts such as Godoy, the practice is alarming.\\n\\nAngelina Godoy is still seeking documents about ICE\\'s detention of minors.\\n\\n\"I may not object to the fact they are being held,\" said Godoy, director of the Center for Human Rights at the University of Washington. \"But I object to the fact that nobody can even know who they are (and) why.\"\\n\\nPublic attention has primarily focused on the treatment of children who recently crossed the border illegally on their own or with their parents. These kids are usually held in Border Patrol camps, family shelters overseen by ICE or on their own in facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for so-called \"unaccompanied\" children, after arriving without any parents or being separated from them.\\n\\nBut teenagers who are already living inside the country with a parent can be classified as accompanied. This means if they are apprehended by ICE, they can be put in secure facilities where ICE has contracted to hold them, mixed among other US youth. Attorneys said most cases they had seen involved undocumented children who had faced a criminal conviction, charge or accusation, but that ICE also has the authority to detain those legally in the country with visas and even green card holders if their criminal records place them in violation of immigration laws.\\n\\nImmigrant youth -- regardless of their residency status -- are supposed to receive a number of legal protections when detained. Yet more than a dozen immigration attorneys describe the agency\\'s detention of minors as a black hole with little oversight or easy access to lawyers who can help them navigate complicated immigration law.\\n\\nThe places these youth are held don\\'t appear on ICE\\'s online map of detention centers.

It did not, however, elaborate on the specific allegations and evidence ICE has used to take them from their families.\\n\\n***\\n\\nPhiladelphia attorney Mary Chicorelli remembers an immigrant mother who was \"beside herself\" after her son was taken from where they lived in North Carolina to a private juvenile detention center in rural Pennsylvania in 2017.\\n\\nImmigration documents show the 16-year-old was turned over to ICE and sent to the facility after being arrested by local authorities over misdemeanor charges for marijuana and gun possession. Chicorelli recalled the teen looking even younger than he was and said he was free of any previous criminal record. She said he repeatedly asked when he would be able to see his mom again.\\n\\nAttorney Mary Chicorelli\\n\\n\"The separation between the respondent and his mother has increased the stress and anxiety given his mother\\'s health,\" Chicorelli wrote in a motion for his release, saying that the mother, a cancer patient, had brought her son to the United States to escape the violence in Honduras.\\n\\nAn immigration judge released him after Chicorelli emphasized in court filings that the teen hadn\\'t been convicted of any of the criminal allegations since the charges were still pending. She stopped representing him after his release and was unable to connect with the family to find out what had happened to him since.\\n\\nAnother North Carolina mother named Leticia, who has gone through immigration proceedings to obtain a visa and only gave permission to use her first name, said that after her 17-year-old son Victor was arrested by police last year, he warned her that ICE agents said they would be picking him up from a Raleigh jail. But she had no idea where they were taking him and no way of finding out.\\n\\nShe said as the weeks dragged on, she became increasingly frantic. She depended on Victor, whom she said she brought to the United States from Mexico when he was five. As her oldest son, he cared for her younger children while she worked long hours. He also supported the family financially by picking up odd jobs and working at McDonald\\'s, where the manager described him as \"responsible,\" \"reliable\" and \"eager to learn,\" according to a letter shared by his attorney.\\n\\nOther kids held by ICE ICE has justified its longer detention of teens by saying they are a safety risk, but the agency also uses a little-known network of juvenile detention centers and other facilities for a different group of kids as they are being shuttled around the country. The most recent data shows that ICE could hold juveniles at six facilities for shorter stints of less than three days. ICE said in July that these places are used in urgent or unusual situations when kids are unable to immediately be transferred to the facilities where unaccompanied migrant children are typically held (run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement). Immigration attorneys interviewed by CNN hadn\\'t heard of this practice and didn\\'t know whether kids held by ICE in juvenile detention centers for these shorter stays would necessarily need to have criminal histories. ICE said there were no children being housed in these places at the time, though at least two facilities confirmed to CNN they had housed kids this year. One of these facilities, the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center, immediately suspended ICE\\'s placement of children there after being contacted by CNN in mid-July. The executive director said ICE placed three kids at the facility this year, and that some members of the commission overseeing it may have been unaware of this -- voting to officially end the agreement in August. \"I think a better system would have made it so this wasn\\'t a surprise to all involved,\" said Christian Dorsey, Chair of the Arlington County Board, which appoints two members of the commission. He worried whether the kids being brought by ICE were able to get legal help and said ICE\\'s detention of kids in this facility wasn\\'t transparent or consistent with the facility\\'s mission. \"It\\'s not a place to essentially warehouse children who are not necessarily being given access to legal representation.\"\\n\\nBut his mother knew Victor had struggled. In a statement he later wrote for his immigration case, Victor, who did not feel comfortable using his full name but agreed to share documentation of his case, said he had a troubled childhood and suffered from depression when his dad left the family. Law enforcement and immigration records show he was convicted of breaking and entering and larceny for a string of car break-ins. He was also convicted of threatening a friend he claimed stole from him. According to a police report, Victor was waiting for the friend when he got off the school bus, took out some sort of knife -- which Victor told his attorney was a pocketknife -- and said \"give me back my s*** or you\\'re going to regret it.\" No one appeared to be hurt in the incident.\\n\\nIt was after receiving a suspended sentence and probation for his latest car break-ins, meaning he was ready to be released by local authorities, that Victor was taken into ICE custody last year. His mom said she worried about whether her son was okay and feared he would be deported back to a country he barely knew. She anxiously tried to find him, she said, asking ICE for information and searching the agency\\'s online locator where family members can track the whereabouts of immigrant detainees. But his name was nowhere to be found.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know anything,\" she told CNN in Spanish in an interview in July. The Seattle Times later published a story about ICE\\'s use of Pacific Northwest facilities which included Victor\\'s account. \"I was afraid he might already be in Mexico.\"\\n\\nShe said she finally learned of his location when Victor called her from a juvenile detention facility in Oregon and told her not to worry about him. In a statement, the facility said parents are typically notified of their child\\'s arrival within 48 hours, but that it could not speak to whether -- or how soon -- contact is made before a kid arrives at the facility.\\n\\nAccording to his mother, Victor spent more than three months detained by ICE in Oregon.\\n\\nStatements in Victor\\'s immigration file from detention officers at the Oregon facility described him as respectful and a \"model youth\" -- saying he had integrity and helped to calm down and mentor other \"more troubled youths.\"\\n\\nHe was facing deportation, but to prevent that from going on his record, he requested \"voluntary departure\" from the immigration court instead -- and his attorney said he was sent back to Mexico when he turned 18.\\n\\n***\\n\\nGovernment data reviewed by CNN shows that ICE has most recently been authorized to hold minors for longer than 72 hours at three juvenile detention facilities: the Cowlitz County Youth Services Center in Washington state, Abraxas Academy in Pennsylvania, run by private prison operator GEO Group, and the Northern Oregon Regional Correctional Facility\\'s juvenile division (NORCOR).\\n\\nAccording to data previously released by ICE through a public records request from a group of immigrant advocacy groups, there have been more than 130 bookings of minors by ICE for more than 72 hours between January 2009 and May 2017 -- a small fraction of the overall number of children detained by the government. The data also shows how some minors were held for hundreds of days, and one for more than a year and a half. It did not specify the circumstances of why the youth were being held. ICE told CNN in July that eight male teenagers were currently being detained but did not say how many have been in its custody since 2017.\\n\\nA high-profile court settlement from 1997, known as the Flores agreement , dictates how immigrant children should be treated while detained. Among a number of protections, children are supposed to be released to known family members \"without unnecessary delay.\" And more restrictive \"secure\" detention is typically meant to be reserved for those considered to be dangerous to themselves or others.\\n\\nAn ICE protocol manual filed in court last year lays out rules for who can be held in secure detention under Flores, stating that this group includes those who the agency determines are \"delinquent\" or \"chargeable as delinquent\" after facing a criminal conviction or accusation. But attorneys who have represented some of these teens say these rules can be left open to interpretation, and that ICE has been able to lock up teens facing a range of charges or accusations the agency views as \"chargeable\" offenses. The lawyers say that fights with classmates or photos on social media that allegedly suggest a gang affiliation have been used as part of the rationale to detain certain teens.\\n\\nCNN reviewed immigration documents from three separate cases. Two involved teens who had faced weapon possession charges, though they hadn\\'t been charged with violent offenses. The third was Victor.\\n\\nUnlike these youths held in juvenile detention facilities, so-called \"unaccompanied\" migrant kids taken into custody, often while crossing the border, are sent to facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. They receive access to legal services through a network of government-funded attorneys who are given lists of children detained by ORR. These attorneys visit the facilities, brief the children on their rights and help them find legal representation.\\n\\nICE said juveniles in its facilities should have legal access as well, saying that youth \"are advised of the pro bono attorney lists that are posted within facilities\" and that staffers can help them call lawyers.\\n\\nBut without a more structured program in place for kids in ICE custody, attorneys and immigrant rights advocates say that it is far harder to make sure every kid actually obtains representation -- making a lack of legal access one of their biggest concerns about the practice.\\n\\nThe same attorneys notified about every kid in ORR detention aren\\'t given a list of those in ICE detention. So even if they wish to help the children for free, they say it\\'s difficult for them to learn who these teens are.\\n\\nThe National Immigrant Justice Center\\'s Altman said that as a result, ICE is able to levy serious allegations of gang affiliation and other unlawful conduct -- and children are left \"hard pressed to defend themselves.\"\\n\\n***\\n\\nAt least two of the three juvenile detention facilities used by ICE have been accused of mistreating kids in the past. Abraxas Academy, in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, has been cited by state regulators for alleged sexual harassment and sexual abuse, as well as excessive use of force to restrain children. In 2015, one staffer who was later fired bit a child, and in 2016 other employees put kids in headlocks, according to the state inspection reports.

Leonardo had painted a portrait of Sforza\\'s previous mistress, Cecilia Gallerani, just a few years earlier. In fact, the walnut panels from the two works seem to come from the same tree, which has helped with attributing this work to Leonardo.

It will be the biggest exhibition of Leonardo\\'s paintings and probably the best collection of his drawings and scientific manuscripts.\"\\n\\nThe 6 loans are the \"Benois Madonna\" from the State Hermitage of St Petersburg, the \"Saint Jerome\" from the Vatican, the \"Musician\" from the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan, the \"Head of a Woman (La Scapigliata)\" from the Galleria Nazionale in Parma, and two paintings both known as the \"Madonna of the Yarnwinder\" -- one from a private collection and the other from The National Gallery in Edinburgh. They will join the five Louvre Leonardos: \"La Belle Ferronnière,\" the \"Virgin of the Rocks,\" the \"Mary and Child with Saint Anne,\" \"Saint John the Baptist\" and the \"Mona Lisa.\"\\n\\nHead of a Woman (Las Scapigliata) is unfinished, like many other Leonardo works.

Obviously, there\\'s always going to be discussions and questions about which of those are by Leonardo himself. But these are the opportunities to test those works.\"\\n\\nNotably absent are the three Leonardos owned by the Uffizi in Florence, Italy\\'s most visited museum, which were the subject of some political controversy and were ultimately labeled as too fragile to be transported by the museums\\' director.

The scientific preparation, the work on the archive documents, the study of Leonardo himself was really more difficult than the diplomatic and logistical aspects of the exhibition.\"\\n\\nThis preparation work includes a thorough analysis of Leonardo\\'s biography by 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari, new scientific analysis of all the Louvre\\'s paintings and a full restoration of three of them: \"Saint Anne,\" \"La Belle Ferronnière,\" and \"Saint John the Baptist.\"\\n\\nThe team\\'s findings included new details about the \"Virgin of the Rocks,\" which Leonardo painted twice after the first version was rejected by its commissioners. Some scholars believe that the refusal was due to the angel ostensibly pointing his finger at St John and looking directly at the viewer, because both those elements were removed from the subsequent version of the painting. But Delieuvin says that the same composition, without the pointing finger, has been discovered under the original version too, and was changed only at the last moment -- what\\'s usually called a pentimento (meaning \"repentance\" in Italian).\\n\\nThe Louvre version of the Virgin of the Rocks. Credit: PHAS/Universal Images Group Editorial/Universal Images Group via Getty\\n\\n\"This helps us tell a new story on the \"Virgin of the Rocks.\" It helps us understand in a better way the artistic personality of Leonardo da Vinci and shape his image of a perfectionist, someone who didn\\'t do a lot of paintings, but each time was striving to find the best composition and the most beautiful pictorial execution,\" said Delieuvin.\\n\\nPutting so many Leonardo works together under one roof has other beneficial side effects, such as progressing the discussion on attribution. Renaissance painters did not sign their works, and most paintings were the product of a workshop, where many artists and apprentices contributed to the same artwork. That has historically spawned debates on whether some paintings show Leonardo\\'s hand or not. \"For example, there are question marks about the degree of Leonardo\\'s intervention on both versions of the \"Madonna of the Yarnwinder.\" Those can really be solved only by seeing these pictures next to others that everyone agrees are by his hand. The fact that both are in the show is a perfect moment to look at the claims of each of those pictures against a series of paintings that we know were painted at the same time,\" said Syson.\\n\\nMona Lisa & Salvator Mundi\\n\\nOne of the show\\'s goals it so reassert the importance of painting in Leonardo\\'s life. According to Delieuvin, Leonardo\\'s prolific work as a botanist, anatomist, mathematician and scientist was entirely functional to his work as a painter, and his aim was to reproduce his study of nature in his paintings.\\n\\nHowever his most famous work, the \"Mona Lisa,\" isn\\'t technically be part of the exhibition, as it will remain in the room where it is normally on display, on the first floor of the museum.\\n\\nThe Mona Lisa is colloquailly know as La Joconde in French and La Gioconda in Italian, meaning \"jovial\" and a pun on the sitter\\'s married name, Lisa del Giocondo. Credit: ERIC FEFERBERG/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\n\"We would have loved to have the \"Mona Lisa\" with us in the exhibition, but each day she gets 30,000 visitors. In the exhibition space, we can only have about 5,000 visitors a day, 7,000 when we do a night opening. Having her in the same space would make it impossible to visit the exhibition, because everyone who visits the Louvre wants to see the \"Mona Lisa,\" explained Delieuvin. Visitors will still be able to see the work with the same ticket, but will have to join the queue.\\n\\nBut, perhaps fittingly for a show about a man who was so inventive about new technologies, visitors will also have to option to check out the painting in virtual reality: \"Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass\" allows for an intimate inspection of the artwork through a VR headset, removing the jostling crowds and the overgrowth of selfie sticks that plague the real world experience.\\n\\nThe Louvre also wanted \"Salvator Mundi\" to be in the show. The painting, whose attribution to Leonardo is disputed , sold at auction in 2017 for a record $450 million and is believed to be owned by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, although its current whereabouts are unknown . \"We asked for the painting and we never changed our mind. We asked for it in 2015, when it was still with the previous owner, Russian collector Dmitry Rybolovlev. We maintained our loan request after 2017, and it\\'s still open today.

In the early 1990s, the Levines, who have been married for 61 years and have three children, became consumed by art as they traveled back and forth to the Netherlands for Aaron\\'s job. They started visiting art museums across Europe, which \"opened up a Pandora\\'s box,\" Barbara explained.\\n\\nAaron became taken with German Expressionism, an emotionally-charged art movement that he felt best captured the passions and moods of the 1920s and 1930s. \"I hooked into that, as a history buff, never having gotten over the fact that I grew up when the Nazis were big,\" he said. \"I wondered how the human psyche translated that into art, and it really caught my fancy.\"\\n\\nBut it was conceptual French artist Marcel Duchamp\\'s \"Boîte-en-valise\" (\"Box in a Suitcase\") -- a series of works created between 1935 and 1941 -- that really triggered the couple\\'s passion for collecting and, specifically, for Duchamp.\\n\\n\"The more you get connected with (Duchamp\\'s work), the more engaging it gets, the more interactive, the more challenging it gets, the more complex it gets.

A few dozen were built and some still fly -- the only commercial aircraft with forward-swept wings.\\n\\nIn the Hansa Jet, however, the wings are swept forward to make the most of the small fuselage and create more space for passengers in an otherwise cramped aircraft, since this position allows the wings to be mounted further back along the plane\\'s body.\\n\\nThe Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB-320 Hansa Jet. Credit: Alamy\\n\\nThe Hansa Jet wings are also swept forward by just a few degrees, compared to 33 degrees in the X-29. Such a radical adjustment meant trading stability for maneuverability, because to maneuver quicker, a plane must be inherently unstable to start with.\\n\\n\"An F-18 fighter jet has an instability factor of only 5%. The X-29, on the other hand, was 35% unstable,\" said Gelzer.\\n\\nBut mounting the wings backwards has another immediate effect. Small appendages called ailerons (meaning \"little wings\" in French), a crucial component to control the plane, are mounted close to the wingtips. When a normal plane stalls -- a loss of lift that can lead to a crash -- ailerons are usually the first thing to stop working, because stalls tend to start at the wingtip due to the way the air flows over the wing. That means loss of control in an already dangerous situation.\\n\\nForward-swept wings, however, force air to flow the opposite way, moving inboard from the wingtips. Therefore, stalls tend to start closer to the fuselage, leaving the ailerons functional for longer and giving pilots much needed control.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 / 8 Among the unorthodox features of the X-29\\'s design were its canards -- horizontal surfaces used to make the plane\\'s nose go up or down -- which were in front of the main wings rather than on the tail like conventional fighters.

The problem is, can you control the airplane? Not until the X-29. It is the only aircraft that had forward-swept wings and explored this \\'post stall\\' environment,\" said Gelzer.\\n\\n\"At the time, this maneuverability was believed to be absolutely essential to fighter superiority. If your airplane is going to stall before mine, I can shoot you out of the sky in a heartbeat.\"\\n\\nWhen stealth came along\\n\\nThe unusual shape of the wings created another problem for the X-29\\'s engineers: weight. Inverted wings are subject to an extreme twisting force that can break them, so they need to be reinforced. But the X-29\\'s wings would have weighed too much if they were made of metal. Instead, the weight was kept down by using advance composite materials, which are now the standard across commercial and military aircraft.\\n\\nThe plane also had a futuristic, digital fly-by-wire system, which used an electronic interface to fly the aircraft instead of traditional manual controls -- another innovative feature that\\'s now commonplace in aviation.\\n\\nTwo X-29s were built by Grumman, the defense contractor behind the successful F-14 Tomcat and the historic Apollo Lunar Module. Grumman won the contract, worth $87 million (around $245 million in today\\'s money) thanks to cost-cutting measures such as using parts from existing fighter jets, including the F-5A and the F-16 Falcon. The project was commissioned by DARPA, the American Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the USAF Flight Dynamics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. NASA handled the test flights.\\n\\nThe X-29s were flown in 422 research missions between 1984 and 1992. But in the end, its most radical features remain confined to history.\\n\\n\"The benefits did not outweigh the disadvantages. But also, stealth came along and became the must-have feature of a jet fighter,\" said Gelzer.\\n\\nStealth allows planes to be invisible to radar, and it offers such advantages that many modern fighters are not even optimized for aerial battles, or dogfights, which have become rare.\\n\\nOne of the two X-29 as it looks today at the Armstrong Flight Research Center in southern California. Credit: NASA/Ken Ulbrich\\n\\nForward-swept wings have also been made obsolete by thrust vectoring, or the ability to physically move an engine to control the direction of its thrust, ensuring maneuverability even in case of stall. \"You can accomplish almost everything the X-29 was able to do in an F-22 with modern aerodynamics and thrust vectoring,\" said Gelzer.\\n\\nNevertheless, the plane is fondly remembered. \"Those who participated in the program speak very highly of it. People are really enamored with this strange looking airplane. And NASA was critical to the program: it contributed pilots, engineers, maintenance and housing for the aircraft. It was integral right from the start.\"\\n\\nA Russian clone?\\n\\nThe X-29 wasn\\'t the last of its kind, however. On Sept. 25, 1997 -- five years after the X-29\\'s final mission -- the Russian Air Force flew the Sukhoi Su-47, its own version of a fighter jet with forward-swept wings. Nicknamed \"Berkut\" (Russian for \"golden eagle\"), it was the result of a project that was launched in 1983, but was delayed due to the dissolution of the USSR.\\n\\nSimilarities in the design and timing of the plane suggest that it may have been directly inspired by the X-29. \"It\\'s hard not to draw that conclusion, that they saw this and they decided, \\'We\\'d better find out if it works as well,\\'\" said Gelzer.\\n\\nHowever, the Su-47 was almost twice as big as the X-29 and was built more like a full-fledged fighter than an experimental testbed. Despite this, the aircraft never entered production and only one was built.\\n\\nThe Sukhoi Su-47 Berkut. Credit: Alamy\\n\\nIn 2015, a Russian firm started testing the SR-10 , a small inverted wing fighter jet, with the intention of offering it to the Russian Air Force, signaling that the design might still be somewhat viable.\\n\\nBut will we ever see another fighter jet with forward-swept wings from NASA or the Air Force? Don\\'t hold your breath, said Gelzer.\\n\\n\"I can see that happening from smaller firms, but not from the big military builders and designers. I think it would take something extraordinary for them to return to this concept.\"\\n\\nTop image: An X-29 lifts off from the runway at Edwards Air Force base on a 1989 test flight.', 'Written by Emily Dixon, CNN\\n\\nSay you\\'re asked to name a supermodel.

You can see how models like that can command much bigger salaries.\"\\n\\nSupermodel Coco Rocha, who was cultivating her enormous online following when Jenner and the Hadids were still in high school, credits social media with the return of the super. The difference between the pre-and post-digital supermodels (Rocha is definitely a post, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram alone), is that the latter have no air of mystique. \"Nowadays, you know where they eat, you know where they shop, you know who they\\'re dating, whereas before you knew nothing,\" Rocha says.\\n\\nSisters Bella and Gigi Hadid are two of the social media generation\\'s most famous supermodels.

While they\\'re certainly on the curriculum, according to Rocha, \"the majority of the classes is learning about social media and what that has to offer for us.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s an approach to model school that Phelps admires, telling CNN Style, \"Thanks to social media, even models who aren\\'t supermodels can build brands and go on to have very successful careers.\"\\n\\nMost models, even those who walk for the most prestigious fashion houses, won\\'t ever reach the exalted rank of \"supermodel\" -- as Phelps explains, there are \"hundreds of thousands of models working today.\" But whether it\\'s Naomi Campbell or Kendall Jenner they idolize, the elusive allure of the first wave or the mass online appeal of the latest, it\\'s safe to assume one thing: \"Of course these young models dream of being a supermodel.\"', 'CNBC | Jaden Urbi\\n\\nA fresh start\\n\\nU.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez & U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on stage at Bernie Sanders Rally \"Bernie\\'s Back\" in Queensbridge Park.

Now, leading presidential candidates are calling for such a reset. Bernie Sanders has proposed wiping out the country\\'s $1.6 trillion outstanding student loan tab. Essentially, all borrowers would be freed from their debt. \"This is truly a revolutionary proposal,\" Sanders told The Washington Post. Under Elizabeth Warren\\'s plan, borrowers with household incomes of less than $100,000 would get $50,000 of their student debt forgiven. People who earn between $100,000 and $250,000 would be eligible for forgiveness on a sliding scale – that $50,000 in debt relief drops by $1 for every $3 a person earns over $100,000. And those who earn more than $250,000 would be ineligible for debt forgiveness. At a recent campaign event, Kamala Harris hinted that she\\'d be rolling out a plan soon to forgive the student loan debt of families who earn less than $100,000 a year. This week a senior government official appointed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned, saying the current student loan system is \"fundamentally broken\" and calling for billions of dollars in debt to be forgiven. A. Wayne Johnson proposes to forgive $50,000 in student debt for all borrowers, about $925 billion. \"It\\'s the first Republican support for widespread student loan forgiveness,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a higher education expert. \"That makes it a bipartisan issue.\"\\n\\nHigher Education Act', 'The \"Fast Money\" traders shared their first moves for the market open.\\n\\nTim Seymour was a buyer of AT&T.\\n\\nKaren Finerman was a seller of eBay.\\n\\nMark Tepper was a buyer of Activision Blizzard.\\n\\nGuy Adami was a buyer of Valero.\\n\\nDisclosure\\n\\nTrader disclosure: Karen Finerman\\'s firm is long ANTM, C, CBS, CPRI, FB, FDX, FL, FNAC, GOOG, GOOGL, GLNG, GMLP, HD, JPM, LYV, REZI, RRGB, SPY puts, SPY put spreads, TBT, TGT, URI, WIFI.

It seems that the international risks they\\'ve been citing seem to be fading,\" said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management.\\n\\nSome see the Fed pausing after next Wednesday\\'s cut. Goldman Sachs economists, in fact, expect the Fed to signal it will hold off after that one.\\n\\nMarkets are braced for the Fed to cut rates by a quarter point next week, but some economists say a few of the reasons the Fed gave for making the cuts may be less pressing now.\\n\\nGrant Thornton\\'s chief economist Diane Swonk is in a minority camp that says it\\'s possible the Fed won\\'t cut next week. She says the odds the Fed pauses next week are probably higher than the market expects, and the Fed might be better off waiting.\\n\\n\"The counterargument is you\\'re already cutting. If you cut now, you might boost activity heading into the Christmas shopping season,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said the Fed\\'s so-called insurance cut, however, would be seen as supportive of the economy. It would be the third rate cut in more than decade, all since July.\\n\\nMatus said he expects the Fed to cut rates, but he said odds it takes no action are probably about 30%. \"It\\'s not a foregone conclusion they cut at this meeting.\"\\n\\n\"It seems they shifted from nonquantifiable risks around the world, to more quantifiable risks at home,\" he said. \"I think they believe that would warrant a cut.\"\\n\\n\"My sense is that we still face a 60% chance that the Fed holds the line on rate cuts at its meeting next week. That could disappoint financial markets but could be managed by pledging to stay flexible on rate cuts going forward,\" said Swonk. \"Fed Chairman Jay Powell has been good at conveying this part of the Fed\\'s message.\"\\n\\nShe also pointed to a cooling in the geopolitical risks that were hanging over the Fed at its last meeting, including the Oct. 31 deadline for Brexit. The situation is still surrounded by uncertainty, as the British have now asked for an extension of the deadline into early next year, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson is calling for a Dec. 12 election.\\n\\n\"The outcome of Brexit is still an unknown and, at least for the moment, the administration has lowered the temperature in the trade war with China,\" Swonk said. \"Those shifts, combined with the noise created by the GM strike (which will magnify the losses we are seeing in manufacturing) provide an argument for the Fed to sit out this meeting.\"\\n\\nHowever, she does not expect the Fed to indicate it will continue to pause. \"I still think they have to cut before the end of the year, and I just think there\\'s a more strategic time to do it,\" she said. Swonk expects the Fed to also cut rates next year, and ultimately take the fed funds rate back to zero since she believes the central bank will be fighting a recession.\\n\\nMatus said he does not believe the Fed needed to cut rates at all this year, but that it will probably leave the door open to more cuts.\\n\\n\"My sense is they\\'re not cutting rates because of real events. They\\'re cutting because of market perception. They\\'re trying to calm down market participants so we don\\'t have a credit crunch,\" said Matus. \"They are just trying to keep people calm through the end of the year. I think they\\'re thinking if we keep them happy a little longer, the tide is turning on trade. It seems like there\\'s some resolution in Europe and maybe the rest of world will calm down a bit. With a strong consumer, maybe that will be enough.\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, Joseph LaVorgna, Natixis chief Americas economist, expects the Fed to cut rates next week and then again before the end of the year.\\n\\n\"The Fed has got to get the yield curve steep and right now the 2-year note at 1.56% and the fed funds target at 1.88%, it\\'s not enough,\" he said. LaVorgna added that the Fed has to make more cuts to further steepen the curve, and he expects it to make the quarter point cut next week, plus another later this year.\\n\\nThe yield curve temporarily inverted, meaning in this case the 2-year Treasury yield rose above the 10-year Treasury yield. An inversion is often a recession warning sign. But in this case, LaVorgna notes that the Fed cut rates and the curve was inverted for just a short time, instead of for months, as it\\'s been in the past.\\n\\nSwonk said another consideration for the Fed to stay on hold is that it would risk fewer dissents at the meeting. One voting member, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, has moved more toward holding off for now. The Fed would move again if risks become greater.\\n\\nShe said two other proponents of cuts, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voter, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, a nonvoter, have changed their views on more aggressive half point rate cuts and now seek just a quarter point cut.\\n\\n\"If the Fed cuts another quarter point, as markets expect on October 30, Presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Esther George of Kansas City are expected to dissent again.

Wayne Johnson was hired as the chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, which manages the country\\'s $1.6 trillion outstanding student loan portfolio. He later worked in a strategic role, directing how student loans are serviced for borrowers.\\n\\nJust last week, DeVos called Democrats\\' plans to erase student debt \"crazy.\"\\n\\n\"Who do they think is actually going to pay for these?\" DeVos said in an interview on Fox News.\\n\\nJohnson told The Wall Street Journal he reached his conclusion after watching climbing defaults and realizing that a majority of student debt will never be repaid.\\n\\nIndeed, five years into repayment, half of student loan borrowers haven\\'t paid even $1 toward their debt\\'s principal, according to the Education Department\\'s own data. And 40% of student loan borrowers could default by 2023, according to an analysis by the Brookings Institution.\\n\\n\"We run through the process of putting this debt burden on somebody … but it rides on their credit files — it rides on their back — for decades,\" Johnson, who wrote his dissertation at Mercer University on student debt, told the Journal.\\n\\n\"The time has come for us to end and stop the insanity,\" he added.\\n\\nJohnson proposes forgiving $50,000 in student debt for all borrowers, about $925 billion, according to the newspaper. For people who\\'ve already repaid their debt, he suggests offering them a $50,000 tax credit. The plan would be paid for with a 1% tax on corporate earnings.\\n\\nAt the same time, Johnson announced he\\'d be running for an open Senate seat in Georgia.', 'It could take a century for women to be paid as much as men, if things stay as they are now.\\n\\nThe wage gap between men and women is 20%, meaning women get paid 80 cents for every $1 men earn. In the last ten years, the pay gap only narrowed about 2%, and if performance stays consist with the past decade\\'s, it would take 100 years to reach equal pay, according to Goldman Sachs.\\n\\n\"The latest data show there\\'s more work to do,\" said Amanda Hindlian, global COO of global investment research at Goldman Sachs in a note titled \"Closing the Gender Gaps 2.0.\"\\n\\nGoldman used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2015 to 2019 to figure the gender wage gap among prime-age U.S. workers remains 20% today. That figure is unchanged from last year\\'s work, which used data from 2013 to 2017. The situation is not improving. It was only June, when the last company in the S&P 500 with an all-male board added its first female member.\\n\\nThe only aspect that has changed since last year was the number of \"unexplained\" percentage points in the gap, which has risen to 18.1% from 17.5%. Educational background, work experiences and nature of the jobs can explain less than 2% of why this gap exists. That leaves more than 18% of the gap likely explained by gender.', 'This year could be one of the best ones ever for investors if the gains in four major asset classes hold.\\n\\nStocks, bonds, gold and crude oil are all up nicely for the year. In fact, this could be the first year ever in which all four asset classes rise at least 10%, according to LPL Financial.\\n\\nThe S&P 500 has returned nearly 22% in 2019. Gold and crude are sporting returns of 16.1% and 17.8%, respectively. Bonds are close, with the 10-year Treasury note up more than 9%. The sharp returns across the four major asset classes are a surprise to many investors who have been worried about U.S.-China trade, slowing global economic growth and lackluster corporate earnings.\\n\\n\"As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image,\" Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, said in a statement.\\n\\nStocks posted their worst annual performance since 2008 last year after a series of Federal Reserve rate hikes, coupled with rising trade tensions, sent shockwaves through capital markets. Bonds, gold and oil also had a down year in 2018.\\n\\nThe strong performance across asset classes was sparked in large part by a policy shift by the Fed. The U.S. central bank has cut rates twice this year and ended a balance-sheet reduction process earlier than expected.\\n\\nBond prices move inversely to rates, so the Fed\\'s monetary policy moves have led to higher Treasury returns in 2019. Lower Fed rates can also spur inflation and boost economic growth, making gold and oil more attractive. Lower rates also makes it cheaper for companies to borrow money to expand their business or increase their share repurchase programs, boosting stocks. Generally strong consumer confidence has also boosted assets, particularly stocks.', 'Investors betting against Elon Musk\\'s electric-auto maker Tesla collectively lost an estimated $1 billion-plus on Thursday as the company\\'s stock headed for its best day on Wall Street since 2013.\\n\\nTesla popped 16.5% Thursday to around $300 per share, meaning short sellers betting against the stock are on track for $1.4 billion in mark-to-market losses on the day — wiping out almost 70% of short sellers\\' year-to-date profits, estimates S3 Analytics.\\n\\n\"Short sellers are, as Elon Musk stated earlier in the year, \\'feeling the burn,\\'\" wrote Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director at S3. \"Prior to today\\'s price move TSLA short sellers were up +$2.00 billion in mark-to-market profits, this is down from its year-to-date P/L high of +$5.16 billion of mark-to-market profits before TSLA began its sustained rally in June.\"\\n\\nTo be sure, those who bet against Tesla at the start of 2019 are still in the black to date with the equity down more than 11% this year after Thursday\\'s price moves.

Markets widely expect the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee to approve a quarter-point reduction at the Oct. 29-30 meeting that will take the target range for the funds rate down to 1.5% to 1.75%. Goldman concurs, assigning a 95% probability of a cut. The rate applies to what banks charge each other for overnight lending, but influences a broad swath of consumer debt as well. However, that could be it for a while.\\n\\nGoldman economists see the Fed tweaking some language in its statement to indicate that this move, the third policy easing of the year, will fulfill the central bank\\'s \"midcycle adjustment\" that Chairman Jerome Powell alluded to in July. The characterization rankled some on Wall Street, but Powell has largely stuck to the narrative that economic conditions are otherwise solid even as the Fed has moved to relax financial conditions. In making the rate cuts, Fed officials have said that they are largely in response to fears of global slowing, U.S.-China tariffs and tame inflation rather than an indication that the U.S. economy is in trouble. \"Strong signaling from Fed leadership indicates that the modest trade war de-escalation since September has not deterred them from completing a 75bp, 1990s-style \\'mid-cycle adjustment,\\'\" Goldman economist Spencer Hill said in a note to clients. Tempering the language to a less acommodative tone would be in keeping with recent statements coming out of the central bank. Some fed officials at the September meeting expressed concern that the market was expecting more in terms of rate cuts than the Fed was likely to deliver, according to minutes from the two-day gathering.\\n\\nRemoving \\'act as appropriate\\'', 'Total payment volume — a closely watched metric for PayPal and its peers — came in at $178.7 billion, also above expectations.

Revenues also outperformed, with $4.38 billion in the quarter vs. the $4.35 billion expected. Its forward guidance for next year was in line with expectations.\\n\\nShares of the payment company closed more than 8% higher, a day after PayPal beat Wall Street\\'s estimates across the board for the third-quarter results.\\n\\nIts mobile payment app Venmo was a key bright spot. Despite not yet breaking even for its parent company, the app saw 64% growth in payment volume year over year. Venmo also processed more than $27 billion in the quarter. On a call with analysts, CEO Dan Schulman called the app \"an incredibly powerful platform for engaging consumers\" and that he was \"pleased\" with its monetization progress.\\n\\n\"We see a lot of good runway in front of Venmo,\" Schulman said. PayPal ended the third quarter with an annual revenue run rate just shy of a $400 million, compared with $200 million last quarter.\\n\\nWilliam Blair analyst Robert Napoli said in a note Thursday that \"Venmo losses are moderating, which is supporting margin expansion.\"\\n\\nPayPal also announced good news in China. After years in the works, PayPal got approval from the People\\'s Bank of China to acquire a 70% stake in Shanghai-based GoPay. The start-up has digital payment licenses in China. That deal is expected to close in December and will make PayPal the first licensed foreign-payment platform to operate there.\\n\\n\"This is a very significant development for us and has the potential to dramatically expand our total addressable market and our long-term growth prospects,\" Schulman said on the call.\\n\\nStill, some investors had been worried about an upcoming expiration of the PayPal-eBay exclusive operating agreement. The roll-off from eBay, which used to own PayPal, is seen as a headwind for earnings into the next two years.\\n\\nBut MoffettNathanson\\'s Ellis said by dissolving that exclusive partnership, PayPal can ramp up at least four new high-growth platforms: Paymentus, Facebook, Mercado Libre, and Uber.\\n\\n\"PayPal will emerge from the eBay transition in a stronger competitive position and healthier financial position,\" Ellis said. \"The primary uncertainty in the eBay roll-off is its exact timing (how much in 2020, 2021, or beyond) – its overall magnitude is well-defined.\"\\n\\nCorrection: This story was revised to correct the spelling to Schulman.', 'Star stock picker and longtime money manager Jeffrey Vinik explained Thursday that he\\'s shuttering his hedge fund because would-be investors balked at his investment strategy, a reluctance that ultimately capped how much his relaunched firm was able to raise.\\n\\n\"Long/short equity performance has not been good the last five to 10 years.

The manager had hoped to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion, but ultimately raised only about one-sixth of his goal.\\n\\nIn his letter, the fund manager explained to stakeholders that \"it has been much harder to raise money over the last several months than I anticipated.\" Vinik said on Thursday that the lackluster fundraising was likely related to the underperformance of hedge funds versus the broader stock market in recent years.\\n\\nVinik\\'s announcement earlier this week came just months after he told CNBC in January that he was relaunching his firm. Since then, however, Vinik Asset Management funds rose 4.8% on a net basis between March 1 and Sept. 30; the S&P 500 climbed 6.1% and returned 7.39% over the same period.\\n\\nBut Vinik told CNBC that he was happy with the performance this year and that\\'s not why he had trouble raising funds. He said heightened standards imposed by modern asset allocators were part of the problem, who need to see a recent and stable track record of solid performance.\\n\\nIt\\'s \"very different than 10 years ago, 20 years ago.

Fintech companies had welcomed a special bank charter that cleared a quicker path for them to become a bank. But that was dealt a blow this week as a federal district court in New York decided that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the regulator issuing the charters, didn\\'t have the authority to do so. The ruling highlights the sometimes murky nature of tech companies getting into banking. It also means that finance start-ups will have to go through the same drawn out process as everyone else.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a step back for fintechs that are looking long term to become banks,\" said Lindsay Davis, fintech analyst at CB Insights. \"A fintech charter helped streamline that regulatory process for a company getting into the market.\" The \"fintech charter\" looked to expedite the process by allowing a start-up to offer lending or payments products without having to accept FDIC insurance, or comply with banking regulations state-by-state. A spokesman for the agency said it \"disagrees with the decision and the court\\'s interpretation of the authority the National Bank Act grants the OCC\" and plans to appeal the ruling. Without the special exception, getting a national bank charter tends to take around 18-24 months, according to Deloitte. \"This might be a longer process than fintechs would have anticipated — the other options are lengthy and cumbersome,\" said Alaina Sparks, head of Deloitte\\'s fintech team. \"The OCC charter sparked tremendous interest and got people thinking about new options.\" Advocates of the fintech charter said it would have increased competition by allowing new entrants to the financial system. But the ruling was a win for state regulators, many of whom wanted to block the pathway for fintech. They pushed back on non-banks\\' potential to operate across the U.S. without needing to comply with state-by-state laws, which included caps on loan interest rates. \"The decision stops OCC\\'s attempt to usurp state authority by establishing a federal fintech regulatory framework at the expense of consumers,\" New York\\'s superintendent of financial services, Linda A. Lacewell, said about the court ruling. \"This decision makes the financial well-being of consumers from New York and around the country a priority.\"\\n\\nOther options\\n\\nSource: Square\\n\\nStill, there are other avenues. Square has applied with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for a special industrial loan company license that allows less traditional financial firms to accept government-insured deposits. Stock-trading start-up Robinhood submitted an application to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or OCC, for a national bank charter. Deloitte\\'s Sparks said those that were looking into the fintech charter will likely still consider similar options. Fintech firms have managed to tap into the financial system without being a bank. They often partner with traditional community banks to handle the federally insured side of things, while the start-up handles the app and consumer interface. Apple and Goldman Sachs are the most recent example with the launch of the Apple Card.\\n\\nSource: Apple\\n\\nFew start-ups had actually applied, which Propel Ventures general partner Ryan Gilbert said was due to the ongoing litigation. \"A ruling like this slams on the brakes,\" Gilbert said. \"The VC community was excited about the fintech charter, and thought it was an opportunity. But that enthusiasm has died because of lawsuits and lack of clarity.\" Despite the lack of new bank charters, funding for the fintech space is surging. Through the third quarter of 2019, fintech companies have raised more than $12.8 billion in the U.S alone, according to data from CB Insights. Last year, global VC spending on fintech start-ups topped $39 billion in 2018, more than doubling from a total $18 billion a year earlier.', 'Check out the companies making headlines after the bell:\\n\\nTesla shares surged more than 14% during extended trade after a big earnings beat.

That might not have gone over too well.\"\\n\\nA mid-September cash crunch in the repo, or repurchase, market led the Fed to conduct a series of repo and term repo operations to make sure that banks have the overnight funding they need at rates within the central bank\\'s intended parameters.\\n\\nFunding constraints caused the repo rate to jump to as high as 10% from around 2%, while the funds rate briefly rose 5 basis points above its target range.\\n\\nIn addition to the repo increase, term repo operations are rising to $45 billion, from $35 billion. In addition to those two operations, the Fed recently announced a permanent operation that will target $60 billion a month initially in bond purchases that will resemble the three rounds of quantitative easing employed during and after the financial crisis.\\n\\nHowever, the Fed now is addressing the proper amount of bank reserves in the system rather than looking to juice up the economy, as was done during QE.\\n\\nWATCH: What it means when the Fed conducts a \\'repo\\' operation', 'Negative interest rates have served as an effective policy tool for countries that have implemented them, at least in terms of easing financial conditions, according to a Federal Reserve study. In a recent research paper, San Francisco Fed economist Jens H.E. Christensen looked at the results of five foreign central banks that implemented subzero rates starting in 2012, when the Danish National Bank first went negative. In each case, the move immediately brought government rates down and helped loosen up those economies. Had the U.S. done the same, Christensen wrote, its growth rate after the financial crisis might have been better. The U.S. Federal Reserve took its benchmark rate down to a target range of zero to 0.25% at one point, but never crossed the threshold to go negative. \"Evidence that the U.S. post-crisis economic recovery was constrained by this policy choice ... suggests that mildly negative U.S. policy rates from 2009 to 2011 could have supported higher economic growth and eventually pushed up inflation closer to the Federal Reserve\\'s target,\" he said.\\n\\nThe conclusions go directly at some central beliefs held by Fed officials: That the \"effective lower bound\" is somewhere close to zero but not below, and that charging depositors to store their money isn\\'t an effective strategy to boost growth and spark a healthy level of inflation, which the bank estimates to be 2%. The Fed has struggled to reach the target, mirroring weak inflation across other global economies, including those that have used negative rates. There is some $17 trillion worth of negative-yielding government bonds in circulation globally. President Donald Trump has implored the Fed to cut aggressively, tweeting in September that it should \"get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less.\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, at September\\'s policy meeting, said officials considered the merits of going below zero but choose against the strategy. \"So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do,\" he told media members after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Powell said the strategy of using large-scale asset purchases — quantitative easing — along with forward guidance telling the public of its long-term intentions, served the Fed\\'s purpose. \"We feel that they worked fairly well. We did not use negative rates,\" he said. \"And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound — again, not something we are expecting — then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance. I do not think we\\'d be looking at using negative rates. I just don\\'t think those will be at the top of our list.\" Christensen argues, though, that effective lower bound \"is clearly located significantly below zero.\"\\n\\n\\'A constraint only in theory\\'', 'With about one-fourth of the S&P 500 reporting third quarter earnings, several high-profile earnings misses have analysts wondering if the long-feared earnings recession may be getting closer.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Federal Express, McDonald\\'s and now Caterpillar and Boeing have all missed earnings expectations by a significant amount:\\n\\nEarnings misses (from expectations) FedEx 3% McDonald\\'s 5% Caterpillar 8% Boeing 30%\\n\\nIn addition, Texas Instruments gave very poor revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, roughly 11% below consensus.\\n\\nThese misses are not trivial. This quarter, 83% of the companies reporting have beaten expectations by an average of 4.2%, according to Refinitiv, so earnings misses of any sort by a large company are fairly rare.\\n\\nWhile the misses are not trivial, others are noting that they are indeed outliers. Nick Raich, who tracks earnings at the Earnings Scout, notes that about 14% of companies are missing earnings estimates this quarter, about in-line with historical trends.\\n\\nRaich also noted that most of these large misses are either company specific or sector specific. The issue of Boeing and the 737 Max jet are well known. FedEx had many company specific issues; its competitor UBS did not report the same type of problems. McDonald\\'s reported U.S. same store sales below expectations, but there was significant traffic diversion around the \"chicken sandwich\" wars at competitors like Popeye\\'s.\\n\\nRaich\\'s conclusion: \"If FedEx and McDonald\\'s and Boeing really reflected trends in the broader economy, you\\'d be seeing far more companies missing and overall guidance much worse than it is.\"\\n\\nThat leaves Caterpillar, which has become the poster child for tariff wars and the global industrial economy. On the conference call, Caterpillar executives specifically cited reduced dealer inventory \"due to uncertainty in the global economy resulting from trade tensions and other factors,\" and also that end user demand was flat. The implication was that this would continue into the fourth quarter and possibly into 2020.\\n\\nRaich notes that the Street has been well aware of Caterpillar\\'s problems (revenues are flat this year, earnings barely positive), reflected in the fact that the stock is up only 5% this year.\\n\\n\"Caterpillar\\'s earnings trends have been very poor for over a year, but I\\'m hoping now that the worst of the earnings cuts are over. A year ago I would have said no,\" Raich told me.\\n\\nThe Street seems to believe that the worst of the earnings downtrend for Caterpillar is indeed over: the stock is up today on what appears to be very poor earnings and guidance.\\n\\n\"The stock reaction is telling you, bad news is already priced in,\" Stefanie Link with Nuveen said on our air today.\\n\\nA bigger issue: is the global growth malaise getting priced in? Many observers have noted that the market narrative has shifted from \"fear of a recession in 2020\" to \"slower growth in 2020,\" a far less menacing narrative.\\n\\n\"This has become the muddle-through market,\" Alec Young, Managing Director, Global Markets Research at FTSE Russell, told me. \"People are expecting one to two percent GDP growth, and five percent or less earnings growth,\" in 2020.\\n\\nThrow in expectations of fiscal stimulus from Europe, and the remaining large wildcards are China trade and the Fed.\\n\\n\"We need news on trade or the Fed to get us to break out of the range we are in.\" he told me. \"We need to have the next round of tariff increases in December come off the table,\" adding he expected the Fed to cut rates for the third time this year next week.\\n\\nThe problem, Young concluded, is the risk-reward is not very well balanced. If things go well, the market could grind higher 10% in the next few months. If things don\\'t go well, the downside is definitely greater than the upside.', 'Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former Securities and Exchange Commission investigator with obstruction of justice, unauthorized computer access and disclosure of confidential information to a firm where he sought employment.\\n\\nThe defendant, Michael S.

On Friday, the US aviation regulator revoked the company\\'s certification.\\n\\nThe sensor fed information to the plane\\'s Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System - or MCAS. That software, which is designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling, has been a focus for investigators trying to find the cause of both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes.\\n\\nIndonesian investigators identified issues with the system, which repeatedly pushed the plane\\'s nose down, leaving pilots fighting for control.\\n\\nIt showed there were incorrect assumptions about how the MCAS control system would behave and that the \"deficiencies\" had been highlighted during training.\\n\\nFurther, the report found that the first officer, who had performed poorly in training, struggled to run through a list of procedures that he should have had memorised.\\n\\nHe was flying the plane just before it entered into the fatal dive, but the report said the captain had not briefed him properly when he handed over the controls as they struggled to keep the plane in the air.\\n\\nThe report also found that 31 pages were missing from the plane\\'s maintenance log.\\n\\nIndonesian investigators have previously said mechanical and design problems were key factors in the crash of the Lion Air plane.\\n\\nThis report describes a catalogue of failures - from poor communication to bad design to inadequate flying skills - which culminated in the deaths of 189 people.\\n\\nThere are lots of what-ifs here. If the crew of the previous days flight had given a more detailed description of the problems they\\'d faced, the aircraft might never have taken off on its fatal flight. And if the captain, who\\'d successfully kept the plane in the air - despite the intervention of a rogue automated system he didn\\'t understand - hadn\\'t handed over to his less-capable first officer, disaster might still have been avoided.\\n\\nAs Boeing\\'s chief executive Dennis Muilenburg has repeatedly stated, there was a chain of events. But at the heart of that chain was MCAS - a control system that the pilots didn\\'t know about, and which was vulnerable to a single sensor failure.\\n\\nBoeing - and regulators - allowed the system to be designed in this way and didn\\'t change it after the Lion Air crash, leading to a further disaster. And that means that while the report clearly points to serious failures by a parts supplier and by the airline itself, it is Boeing that will bear the greatest share of responsibility.\\n\\nHow has Boeing responded?\\n\\nIndonesian authorities laid out some recommendations for Boeing in the report, including that it redesign MCAS and provide adequate information about it in pilot manuals and training.\\n\\nIn a statement, Boeing said it was \"addressing\" the recommendations from Indonesia\\'s National Transportation Safety Committee.\\n\\nThe planemaker said it was \"taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again\".\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the firm ousted Kevin McAllister, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, making him the most senior official to leave the company since the two crashes.\\n\\nBoeing also said it expected the 737 Max to be re-certified for flying by the end of the year.

UK elections usually take place in May or June - the last December election was in 1923 - so what difference might a winter election make?\\n\\nAre all the polling stations booked up?\\n\\nElections are huge organisational feats. Millions of polling cards have to be distributed. Postal votes need to be sent. And thousands of school halls, churches and community centres have to be booked to be used as polling stations.\\n\\nThe worry is that lots of these locations will already be booked up in mid-December for Christmas events.\\n\\nLaura Lock, of the Association of Electoral Administrators, says her members have been making calls, and finding many of the usual venues already have bookings.\\n\\n\"We will find polling stations,\" she told BBC Radio 4\\'s Today programme - but they might not be where people expect. Voters could find themselves casting their ballots in garages or under caravan awnings.\\n\\nAnd the counting of votes, which takes many hours and relies on volunteers, may also have to take place in similarly makeshift locations.\\n\\nWill bad weather stop people voting?\\n\\nThis is an enduring idea which instinctively feels right. In the cold and damp December weather, surely people will be less inclined to turn out and vote.\\n\\nHowever, experts say there is no evidence from the UK to suggest that bad weather stops people from voting.\\n\\nResearch from the University of Oxford found virtually no correlation between the weather and turnout - instead people are more likely to vote if the election race is close and there is a strong difference between the leading parties.\\n\\nThey are far less likely to vote if it feels like a foregone conclusion, or the main candidates seem relatively close in their political outlook.\\n\\nWhat about shorter days?\\n\\nAs in the case of polling stations, the shorter winter days provide a logistical challenge for election organisers.\\n\\nSome are already planning to buy in temporary street lighting for health and safety reasons, according to Laura Lock.\\n\\nThey may also have to make practical provisions for bad weather like hiring gritters and ensuring extra transport for people who find it harder to get out to vote.\\n\\nAs for whether shorter days might put people off voting, we don\\'t have evidence for that.\\n\\nProf Sir John Curtice at Strathclyde University told the BBC that in the post-war period there have been two winter elections in February, and both had high turnouts.\\n\\nBoth shorter days and poor weather might make life more difficult for people knocking on doors during the campaign.\\n\\nWill it stop students voting?\\n\\nIt was suggested when Prime Minister Boris Johnson attempted to call an election for mid-October that this could limit the student vote. At the beginning of the academic year, many would not yet have had time to register to vote in their new places of residence.\\n\\nIf an election happens on 12 December, which is close to the end of term, that could also cause confusion about whether students should be registered at home or near to where they\\'re studying.\\n\\nBut this issue is more about calling an election at short notice than because it\\'s winter.\\n\\nRead more from Reality Check\\n\\nSend us your questions\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Boris Johnson is at odds with Parliament on the issue of leaving the EU without a deal\\n\\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly said the UK will leave the European Union (EU) on 31 October \"deal or no deal\".

Until the change is formalised, the legal \"exit date\" remains at 31 October.\\n\\nMPs reject an EU proposal\\n\\nNow that the EU has agreed to an extension, it could still offer the UK a leaving date other than 31 January. In that instance, MPs would have up to two days in which they could vote to reject the proposal. If they don\\'t vote, the proposal is automatically agreed to.\\n\\nThe EU may not announce the length of the extension until Tuesday, meaning any vote by MPs could theoretically happen on 31 October itself.\\n\\nIf the proposal was rejected, the extension would be off and a no-deal Brexit would happen next Thursday.\\n\\nMPs would be unlikely to reject a proposal, however, for two reasons:\\n\\nIt would probably lead to a no-deal and most MPs want to avoid this\\n\\nThe government could simply choose not to hold a vote on the extension\\n\\nExtension agreed but UK fails to pass a deal\\n\\nEven with an extension agreed and put in place before the end of the month, a no-deal Brexit is not \"off the table\". Instead, it just pushes the possibility further into the future.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK will need to wait for an answer from the EU\\n\\nRegardless of the length of the extension, the prime minister would probably still try to push his deal through Parliament.\\n\\nHowever, if the government is unable to implement his deal (or another) before the new deadline, the UK would leave without a deal.\\n\\nMinisters refuse to change the deadline\\n\\nThis is the most controversial and unlikely scenario.\\n\\nIf an extension were agreed, a minister would be required to change the deadline in law using something called a statutory instrument (the power to change the law without a vote of MPs).\\n\\nAnd, theoretically, they could simply refuse to do this.\\n\\nBut not only would this be unlawful, it could be argued the \"exit date\" would be automatically changed anyway, because international law trumps domestic law.\\n\\nBrexit explained\\n\\nBrexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU.

But the shocking truth about the buildings is that they continued to house families well into the 20th Century. BBC News Online speaks to a woman who grew up in one.\\n\\nAt the age of eight, Susan Swinton was shown into a room, together with her mother Joan, 10-year-old sister and brothers aged six and one.\\n\\nThe room was narrow - only about 18ft (5.5m) wide - and stark. Cream paint flaked from the walls. Five iron beds with thin sheets, evenly spaced, were set down one side of the room. There was not much other furniture - a table, a cooker, a small sink and a coal bucket.\\n\\nImage caption \"I would stand for hours, just looking out of the window,\" says Susan\\n\\nAt the far end were two barred windows. There were no curtains.\\n\\nIf you tried to look out at the world beyond, your view was blocked by a high line of hedges.\\n\\nA fierce Scottish matron ran the children through a list of rules, most of which started with the words: \"You must not\". They were told they must never go into the orchard at the other side of the building. They must never hang their washing outside. They must never venture through the velvet-lined door - beyond it was the staff quarters.\\n\\nIf they were caught transgressing, the family was told they would be thrown back out on to the streets. The room, the dark passage outside and a small courtyard were to be their domain.\\n\\nThe sprawling, factory-like building to which Susan and her family had been brought was a Victorian workhouse - one of the first to be built in the country. The workhouses\\' harsh regimes, which involved subjecting the \"idle and profligate\" to hard, monotonous tasks such as rock-breaking, would become notorious.\\n\\nBut the shocking thing about Susan\\'s case was that she and her family were not born in the times of Charles Dickens. Their life at Southwell\\'s workhouse, in Nottinghamshire, began in 1968 and lasted until 1971.\\n\\n\"I used to spend hours with my little doll, looking out of those windows, thinking, \\'When is somebody going to come and take us away?\\'\"\\n\\nPauper\\'s path\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The workhouse system had many prominent critics, including the author Charles Dickens\\n\\nSouthwell\\'s workhouse was built in 1824 by the Rev John Beecher, with its architecture influenced by prison design. It was one of the first examples of a notoriously harsh regime, which was adopted nationally in 1834, to force vulnerable people to work in exchange for accommodation and food.\\n\\nThe workhouse was home to 158 inhabitants - men, women and children - who were split up and forbidden from meeting. Those judged too infirm to work were called the \"blameless\" and received better treatment but the rest were forced into tedious, repetitive work such as rock breaking or rope picking.\\n\\nIn 1948, a new welfare system saw the end of Southwell\\'s function as a workhouse and it was used as temporary homeless accommodation until 1976. However, the National Trust, which now owns the site, says some social historians view such shelters as similar to workhouses.\\n\\nAt first, the workhouse provided a kind of sanctuary for Susan and her siblings.\\n\\nUntil then their existence had been precarious, shuffled from place to place as their dad, Brian, moved in and out of prison.\\n\\nImage copyright Susan Swinton Image caption At school Susan (first on the left) was stigmatised because of where she lived\\n\\nFor a while the family lived in a derelict Victorian terrace in Newark, but then Brian moved in with his girlfriend, leaving his family on the street.\\n\\n\"My mum traipsed around to the bus station and we sat there for four hours,\" Susan remembers. \"Eventually, the bus inspector asked us what we were doing and my mum said, \\'We\\'ve nowhere else to go\\'. So we spent the night with the Salvation Army.\"\\n\\nImage caption Coming to the workhouse was, at first, a relief for Susan but steadily the cramped confines wore her down\\n\\nThe next day, the family were taken to Southwell Workhouse - known at the time as Greet House.\\n\\nIn the 20th Century, workhouses became known as public assistance institutions and were intended to provide temporary accommodation for homeless people, but the stigma associated with the regime endured.\\n\\n\"It was a relief at first,\" Susan says. \"My dad wasn\\'t always belting us. He wasn\\'t shouting and screaming at my mum.\"\\n\\nSusan has memories of building a den in the high hedges with her brother and endless hours of reading library books.\\n\\nImage copyright Susan Swinton Image caption Susan describes her mother, Joan, as \"a good mum\" but the workhouse life meant she \"gave up\"\\n\\nBut gradually, the institution began to grind the family down.\\n\\n\"The rules of the place seemed as if they had come from Victorian times,\" Susan recalls. \"We weren\\'t allowed to mix with anybody.\\n\\n\"My dad was back in prison again but it felt as if we had been sent to prison too.\"\\n\\nHer school attendance was sporadic but, when she did go, she remembers the other children calling her a \"Gypsy\".\\n\\nImage caption \"Anybody could have come in and walked up those stairs,\" says Susan\\n\\n\"We were stigmatised because we lived at the workhouse,\" she says.\\n\\nThe long, echoing rooms were frightening for a child, particularly at night.\\n\\n\"There were no lights and the bit we lived in was completely open - anybody could have come in and walked up those stairs,\" says Susan.\\n\\n\"There was a shared corridor that ran down to the toilet and I hated going there, especially at night. I used to imagine people coming up the stairs to get us.\"\\n\\nImage copyright National Trust Images/ Chris Lacey Image caption The whole family had to share one small room\\n\\nAnd living on top of each other, in one small room, took its toll.\\n\\n\"To live in one room for so long with so many people, you just lost all of your privacy,\" said Susan.\\n\\n\"My mum gave up. She didn\\'t care if she lived or died. She would either sit there being quiet, or cry.\"\\n\\nWith her mother, Joan, increasingly dependent on alcohol and sleeping pills, it was left to Susan to care for the family.\\n\\nEach week, she used the family\\'s social security money to buy food and a bottle of sherry for her mum, and to pay the rent to the wardens.\\n\\nShe also had to go to the doctor to get her mother\\'s sleeping pills.\\n\\n\"It was traumatic having to do that,\" she says. \"I was sitting in the waiting room with a begging letter from my mother and everyone knew who I was and why I was there.\\n\\n\"If my mother didn\\'t get her drink or tablets, she would be in a temper. She was a really nice mum but she had been through so much.\\n\\n\"We got to the point where we would do without food so she could have her sherry.\"\\n\\nIt was Susan who did most of the family\\'s cooking - tinned food, mainly - and cleaned the room, which was inspected each week.\\n\\n\"You had to make sure it was clean at all times - that was one of the rules,\" she says.\\n\\nThere were few toys, while second-hand clothes and shoes were provided by a charity.\\n\\nImage caption Susan was left to take responsibility for her family, as her mother\\'s health deteriorated\\n\\n\"None of the shoes ever fitted properly and I didn\\'t know what it was like to get a haircut,\" Susan says.\\n\\nThe other families at the hostel moved on after a few weeks but Susan\\'s family were repeatedly overlooked.\\n\\n\"They just wouldn\\'t give us a council house,\" she says.\\n\\nThe overall feeling was one of having been forgotten.\\n\\n\"We were just left to ourselves,\" she says. \"That\\'s what I feel so angry about now. Why did it take three years to move us out of the workhouse?\"\\n\\nImage caption A small courtyard was the only outside space for the workhouse\\'s 20th Century residents\\n\\nFinally, the family were provided with a council house in Southwell and left the workhouse.\\n\\nA few months after they left, the building stopped being homeless accommodation and was instead used by social services and for elderly care.

It never reached its destination, and millions of TV viewers witnessed the tragedy of its final flight.\\n\\nThe aircraft plunged from the sky more than a thousand miles from where it should have landed, killing its two pilots and four passengers.\\n\\nThe plane hit the ground with such force it disintegrated beyond any possibility of investigative reconstruction.\\n\\nThe jet crashed after the cabin suffered depressurisation, starving the occupants of oxygen. Fighter jets were scrambled and tracked the flight, but were powerless to intervene.\\n\\nPayne Stewart was the star of sport who perished. He was charismatic, one of the most popular players on the planet and a technicolour figure in the often monochrome world of professional golf.\\n\\nHe always stood out, from the moment in his brash younger days when he decided to wear jaunty plus-four trousers as his trademark playing attire. His father, a salesman, had told him it was important to be different.\\n\\nStewart had been heading to the Tour Championship, a big-money event for the 30 best golfers on the PGA Tour. Before arriving at the Houston tournament he planned to stop in Dallas to discuss a course design project.\\n\\nHe was accompanied by his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, along with course architect Bruce Borland. Their pilots were Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue.\\n\\n\"It\\'s fascinating the number of people who know where they were and what they were doing that day,\" says Kevin Robins, author of the recently published book The Last Stand of Payne Stewart.\\n\\n\"I was a reporter in St Louis, Missouri, at the newspaper there. I remember all of us standing around a television.\\n\\n\"It was so stunning, it made no sense, it was discombobulating. A plane up there, so high in the air flying by itself and was it going to land in a city?\\n\\n\"Nobody knew. There were so many questions and no answers.\"\\n\\nThere was nothing amiss when Learjet 35 N47BA made a short hop from Sanford to Orlando\\'s International airport before its final flight.\\n\\nOnce Stewart and his entourage boarded, it taxied to the runway. \"Four-seven Bravo Alpha, clearance follows,\" radioed the ground controller. \"You\\'re cleared to the Dallas Love Field, via the JEFF Six departure, vector Cross City then as filed.\"\\n\\nThe flight took off at 09:19 local time to head north over the Florida panhandle before heading west to Dallas.\\n\\nAfter a routine take-off, Jacksonville Air Traffic Control made contact: \"November Four Seven Bravo Alpha, Jax Centre - climb and maintain flight level three-niner-zero.\"\\n\\nThis was clearance to climb to a cruising altitude of 39,000 feet. \"Three-nine-zero Bravo Alpha\", came confirmation from 27-year-old pilot Bellagarrigue.\\n\\nThese were the final words heard from the cockpit. Within two minutes controllers noticed the flight veering off course as the plane continued a northerly course.\\n\\n\"November Four-Seven-Bravo-Alpha contact Jax centre on one-three-five point-six five.\"\\n\\nNo response.\\n\\nSoon after 10am, more than half an hour after last contact, an F16 fighter jet from Eglin Air Force base near Pensacola, Florida - piloted by Chris Hamilton - was instructed to track the LearJet.\\n\\nFederal aviation authorities knew something was wrong and cleared a corridor of airspace around the plane as it ploughed northwards on autopilot.\\n\\nHamilton caught it over Memphis, Tennessee. \"I got to around 50 to 100 feet from the airplane, close enough to do a good visual inspection,\" he said in a later interview.\\n\\nThere was no outward sign of damage, but there was also no indication of life on board. He radioed back: \"Looks like the front cockpit is either frosted or basically condensed over. I can\\'t see inside the cockpit.\"\\n\\nFrozen windows indicated the pressurisation system, providing vital oxygen, had failed. All those on board must have suffered fatal hypoxia. Further F16s from the Oklahoma National Guard in Tulsa continued the pursuit.\\n\\nNews networks started breaking into their schedules. Word came through that a professional golfer was on board a jet flying out of control. They then identified him as Payne Stewart.\\n\\n\"The occupants of the plane, we are told, are non-responsive,\" reported CNN.\\n\\nStewart\\'s caddie, Mike Hicks, was already scouting the course hosting the Tour Championship in Houston. He was phoned by the professional at his local club to alert him to the news.\\n\\n\"No, they\\'re crazy,\" was all Hicks could say in response.\\n\\nProfessional golf tournaments usually start on a Thursday. There are four rounds of 18 holes, building to a climax when the champion is crowned on a Sunday evening.\\n\\nMondays are quiet. Golfers tend to use them to catch up with family or for corporate work.\\n\\nSome head to the venue of their next event to put in extra preparation work. That week a handful of pros made a Monday visit to the Champions Golf Club in Houston.\\n\\nAmerican stars David Duval and Jim Furyk were there honing their games while officials set up the media centre and facilities. It was quiet when journalist Melanie Hauser pulled into the media parking lot.\\n\\nStewart with caddy Mike Hicks at the 1998 US Open, where Stewart almost won\\n\\nBut she was already aware there was something wrong. It was confirmed by the stunned silence among the early arrivals in the press tent.\\n\\n\"I just said \\'oh my gosh, it can\\'t be Payne!\\'\" the veteran reporter recalls.\\n\\nHauser had known Stewart for 22 years from his college days at Southern Methodist University in Texas. \"I watched him grow into an incredible man,\" she says.\\n\\nNow she was frantically trying to prove the reports wrong; that it was not the reigning US Open champion on that stricken flight.\\n\\n\"We were calling his cell phone. We all got the same recorded message. Something like: \\'This is Payne\\'s cell phone, he\\'s not with me at the moment - leave a message…\\'\\n\\n\"Someone walked past and said: \\'It\\'s definitely Payne\\'. I just remember putting my head on Duval\\'s shoulder, and some tears. Then you realise, \\'oh my gosh, I\\'m going to have to report this\\'.\"\\n\\nStewart\\'s jet travelled over Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri - the state of his birth - and Iowa. Now it was 48,900 feet over South Dakota with its engines having devoured 5,300 pounds of aviation fuel.\\n\\nSoon after noon local time, above the small town of Mina, the LearJet began its fall. \"Minneapolis, the target is descending\", radioed one of the tracking F16 pilots.\\n\\n\"What\\'s he doing?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s doing multiple aileron rolls [a full 360° revolution]. Looks like he\\'s out of control.\"\\n\\nThere was no fire because there was no fuel left to burn. Three hours and 54 minutes after take-off, the plane made its vertical plummet to the ground at close to the speed of sound.\\n\\nIt left a crater 42 feet long, 21 feet wide and eight feet deep. The 23-year-old aircraft was smashed to pieces.\\n\\nBack in Houston, the Champions club was invaded by reporters never usually seen at golf events.\\n\\n\"People that you didn\\'t know were hopping out of trucks and saying \\'can I talk to you?\\'\" Hauser recalls.\\n\\nLike many, she struggles to believe two decades have passed since that tragic day.\\n\\n\"As we\\'re talking right now, I\\'m visualising those guys sitting there and just falling asleep in the plane.\"\\n\\nStewart\\'s distinctive attire made him a popular figure with fans, as here at the 1990 Masters at Augusta National\\n\\nFor all its intense competition, the rivalries it creates and the millions of dollars at stake, professional golf is a tight community. Players share the tribulations of an often maddening game.\\n\\nTheir wives and children co-exist in a weirdly transient and lucratively privileged collective lifestyle. Jumping on and off aircraft is as routine as driving to a supermarket for the rest of us. So the loss of one of their own hits hard.\\n\\nHad any other member of the PGA Tour perished in such circumstances, they would have been mourned as if a family member had gone.\\n\\nBut this tragedy felt even more profound and touched a wider constituency because Stewart was so different. By the time he died at the age of 42 he was at the summit of his sport.\\n\\nStewart pictured with his wife and two children in 1993\\n\\nHe was the guy who wore the funny \\'pants\\', he had a ready smile and a beautiful family. He had matured from being an outspoken and gauche jerk into arguably golf\\'s most charismatic ambassador.\\n\\n\"So many people who loved golf in the 1990s saw Payne Stewart as their favourite player,\" says Robbins.\\n\\n\"He was Hollywood movie star good looking, he had this wonderful family, he had success - and people wanted that. In golf we lost an artist, a shot maker. He was a craftsman on the golf course.\"\\n\\nFew would have envisaged such warm tributes when Stewart began his career as a flash, brash kid out of Springfield, Missouri.\\n\\nGolf\\'s traditions demand politeness, grace and charm from its players. \"Payne Stewart really didn\\'t reflect any of those,\" Robbins says. \"He was loud, he was bombastic, impetuous.\"\\n\\nWhen Stewart won the first of his three majors at the 1989 PGA Championship at Kemper Lakes in Illinois it was not widely applauded. A classless celebration of the capitulation of his closest rival Mike Reid was captured on TV.\\n\\nTwo years later he won his first US Open at Hazeltine, Minnesota, and seemed destined to dominate pro golf throughout the 1990s. But form is fickle, and when he took big money to play a different brand of clubs, the magic deserted his game.\\n\\nRobbins contends this difficult playing period reformed Stewart\\'s character. \"That, I think, has an effect on a man\\'s ego, his humility and sense of self as an athlete.\"\\n\\nIn 1998, Stewart nearly won the US Open at Olympic Club near San Francisco. He was a surprise contender but unlucky to lose. He dealt with the disappointment in a classy, generous manner as another American, Lee Janzen, triumphed.\\n\\n\"He had a peacefulness that he started playing with,\" Janzen told ESPN. \"And I guess an uptightness, that sometimes came across as arrogance, went away.\"\\n\\nStewart was runner-up at the US Open of 1998, won by Lee Janzen (right, with the trophy)\\n\\nA year later, four months before his death, came the biggest moment of Stewart\\'s career. He rolled in a 15-foot winning putt to deny a young Phil Mickelson and win a second US Open.\\n\\nHe punched the air forwards with his right fist as his right leg simultaneously kicked back. This iconic motion is captured in a statue that now stands at Pinehurst, the famed North Carolina resort where he clinched that win.\\n\\n\"The way he took defeat in 1998 helped him win it the next year,\" says Ryder Cup player and captain Colin Montgomerie. \"That\\'s why the celebration was so intense when he did win it.\"\\n\\nThe triumph meant Stewart would play for his country once again in golf\\'s greatest event, the biennial showdown between the US and Europe for the Ryder Cup.\\n\\n\"The first thing he said when he came off was \\'I\\'m in the Ryder Cup team\\',\" recalls Montgomerie, who played against him in that 1999 match at Brookline Country Club in Boston.\\n\\n\"I thought \\'bloody hell, that\\'s what that means to him\\'.\"\\n\\nFour months later Stewart cemented his status as a sporting statesman at that Ryder Cup. America won after an extraordinary comeback but the contest was marred by ugly scenes on the course.\\n\\nStewart\\'s Sunday singles match with Montgomerie was at the heart of the trouble as partisan crowds yelled abuse, with the burly and temperamental Scot a primary target.\\n\\n\"He was very good with me,\" Montgomerie says. \"The singles in the Ryder Cup is a big deal. I was in big trouble and he went into the crowd to have these guys ejected.\\n\\n\"There was a huge incident on the par-five ninth. We had to get some guy ejected in front of my father. All the carry on, it was unreal.\\n\\n\"And yet, he put that ahead of his own patriotism for his team. They were having their own problems to try and get to 14-and-a-half points having started 10-6 down.\"\\n\\nBy the time their game reached the 18th green, the United States had completed a remarkable victory.\\n\\nStewart could still force a tie in his personal battle with a still-determined Montgomerie, in what was the only match left on the course.\\n\\n\"He was on the final green in three and I was on in two,\" recalls Montgomerie. \"He said \\'look Monty, I\\'ve had enough now, pick it up\\' and he gave me that hole.\\n\\n\"I know it\\'s easy to speak good of people who have passed but he was a decent bloke and that\\'s all I can say about him. He was a good guy.\"\\n\\nHad he survived, Stewart would be playing alongside Montgomerie on the Champions Tour for over-50s. As it was, that singles match at Brookline was their last encounter.\\n\\n\"You play him in that and a month later… Christ, he\\'s not with us.\"\\n\\nAmerica\\'s victory meant the world to Stewart. After a six-year Ryder Cup absence he had returned to the elevated stage a more rounded, mature individual playing the golf of his life.\\n\\n\"The last time I saw him I was up at the team room at Brookline. I looked over and he just kind of winked at me and gave me a thumbs up and threw his head back,\" Hauser says.\\n\\n\"That was Payne.

A rock retrieved from the resulting crater sits inscribed with the names of the victims and a psalm from the bible.\\n\\nBefore the tournament Stewart was supposed to be playing in that week, his fellow player Tom Lehman - with whom Stewart shared a strong Christian faith - led a service on the first tee at the Champions Club.\\n\\n\"He was a very emotional guy,\" Lehman told those who had gathered. \"He loved to laugh and was not ashamed to cry.\\n\\nSunrise on Stewart\\'s statue behind the 18th green on Pinehurst\\'s No.2 course - where he won the 1999 US Open\\n\\n\"I\\'m not ashamed of my tears this morning and neither should you be.\"\\n\\nLater that week the remaining 29 competitors interrupted the competition to fly to Orlando for Stewart\\'s formal memorial on the Friday.

They do get a lot of headline news but the motors and the powertronics are absolutely key.\"\\n\\nAnd with new technologies, from 3D printing to in-wheel motors (IWMs) that allow a car to spin on the spot, electric motors could be grabbing more of the limelight.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Improvements in motor technology will mean profound improvements on electric vehicles\\' perfomance\\n\\nMost electric car motors follow the same basic principles, tightly wound coils of wire interact with powerful magnets to create rotation.\\n\\nBut despite a relatively simple set-up, there\\'s still plenty of room for improvement.\\n\\n\"The power of a motor goes up with its speed. What you want to do is spin it as fast as possible in order to make it as small as possible - but then you get into problems of cooling,\" says Ian Foley, managing director of British motor manufacturer Equipmake.\\n\\n\"The limitation now on how you improve the performance of electric motors, is how effectively you can get the heat out of them.\"\\n\\nMore Technology of Business\\n\\nEquipmake\\'s solution is to rearrange the motor\\'s magnets so that they\\'re positioned like the spokes of a wheel.\\n\\nThis not only increases torque (the force which causes rotation), says Mr Foley, but also makes the magnets more accessible, so that cooling water can be run directly over them.\\n\\nThe company is also now using additive manufacturing - 3D printing - to improve cooling and also cut costs.\\n\\n\"There are two main benefits we\\'ll get from additive manufacturing. One is that you can integrate multiple components, so you end up with a much lower component count because things that would previously have been bolted together are all in one piece,\" says Mr Foley.\\n\\n\"The other main thing is the issue of cooling.\\n\\n\"In order to cool you need much more effective heat exchanges, and with additive manufacturing you can effectively increase the surface area inside the motor for the cooling surfaces and therefore get much greater cooling potential.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption One of the key challenges is keeping future high-performance electric motors cool\\n\\nThe company is expecting to have its motors in production in around 18 months\\' time, initially selling them for use in supercars and electric buses - where they\\'re efficient enough to be able to run all day on a single charge. It has already signed a deal with Brazilian automotive manufacturer Agrale.\\n\\nAnd other manufacturers are thinking about a more radical shift.\\n\\nIn most electric cars, the motor is found on one axle and in four-wheel drive cars there will be two motors, one on each axle.\\n\\nBut some companies are working on a radical redesign, placing motors in the wheels themselves.\\n\\nAccording to Chris Hilton, CTO of Protean Electric, in-wheel motors improve handling because the performance of each wheel can be finely controlled.\\n\\n\"They also lower the overall centre of gravity and help to reduce weight and optimise weight distribution in the vehicle,\" he says.\\n\\nImage copyright Protean Electric Image caption In-wheel motors like this can improve handling as they allow you to control the performance of each wheel, says Protean\\n\\n\"Also, because IWMs are located in the wheel, there are minimal losses in transmission of the torque to the road, meaning they are more efficient. This means greater vehicle range, or the same range from a smaller battery.\"\\n\\nProtean\\'s technology is currently being tested by manufacturers of passenger cars, commercial vehicles and even autonomous \"pods\".\\n\\nAnother firm working on in-wheel motors is Japan\\'s Nidec, which announced its prototype earlier this year.\\n\\nAccording to Nidec, the motor has a long list of advantages, not all of them obvious - less noise, for example, thanks to fewer moving parts.\\n\\nBut perhaps the biggest advantage is space. \"Cars that use in-wheel motors don\\'t need a motor compartment,\" says the firm.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say that in ten years electric motors will be unrecognisable from today\\n\\n\"Also, with the elimination of the drive shafts, the wheels can rotate freely. For example, it becomes possible to rotate the wheels 90 degrees and drive to the left or the right, or even rotate in place, instead of just driving forward or backward. This adds another dimension to how the car can move around and makes it easy to navigate tight spaces.\"\\n\\nAPC has set out a roadmap of how it sees electric motors developing; and, by 2025, it expects costs per kilowatt to almost halve, while power density triples.\\n\\n\"For the same amount of power they generate, they\\'ll weigh a third as much and be one third of the package size as well. At the same time the costs will reduce,\" says Mr OudeNijeweme.\\n\\n\"The electric motor will dramatically change. I don\\'t know how quickly, but ten years from now it will be unrecognisable from what you see today, not in how it looks - but in what it does.\"', 'Image copyright Victor Chavez\\n\\nArnold Schwarzenegger means it when he says: \"I\\'ll be back,\" but not everyone is thrilled there\\'s a new Terminator film out this week.\\n\\nIn labs at the University of Cambridge, Facebook and Amazon, researchers fear Terminator: Dark Fate could mislead the public on the actual dangers of artificial intelligence (AI).\\n\\nAI pioneer Yoshua Bengio told BBC News he didn\\'t like the Terminator films for several reasons.\\n\\n\"They paint a picture which is really not coherent with the current understanding of how AI systems are built today and in the foreseeable future,\" says Prof Bengio, who is sometimes called one of the \"godfathers of AI\" for his work on deep learning in the 1990s and 2000s.\\n\\n\"We are very far from super-intelligent AI systems and there may even be fundamental obstacles to get much beyond human intelligence.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Maryse Boyce Image caption AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio thinks we\\'re still a long way off super-intelligent machines\\n\\nIn the same way Jaws influenced a lot of people\\'s opinions on sharks in a way that didn\\'t line up with scientific reality, sci-fi apocalyptic movies such as Terminator can generate misplaced fears of uncontrollable, all-powerful AI.\\n\\n\"The reality is, that\\'s not going to happen,\" says Edward Grefenstette, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research in London.\\n\\nWhile enhanced human cyborgs run riot in the new Terminator, today\\'s AI systems are just about capable of playing board games such as Go or recognising people\\'s faces in a photo.

The site covers 75 acres, with the lake itself measuring 180m long and 200m wide.\\n\\nAlongside raising awareness of environmental issues, those behind The Wave hope to inspire social change. The first people to ride the waves were selected from hundreds of nominees.\\n\\nThey include a group of schoolchildren from central Bristol, some of whom had never seen the sea; Marshall Janson, a youngster from Cornwall who lost his hands and legs to meningitis, and Claire Moodie, who set up the campaign group Plastic Free North Devon.\\n\\nThe complex has also been designed to make the waves accessible to those with even the most severe disabilities.\\n\\nIt was Nick Hounsfield\\'s idea, and it\\'s taken 10 years to see the first wave break.\\n\\nImage copyright Image Cabin Image caption Spike Kane, from the UK adaptive surf team, helped design the site to make it fully accessible\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Wave hopes to inspire social change and raise awareness of environmental issues\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got a real opportunity of getting people, particularly kids, off computers, getting them outdoors, get them interacting with nature, and improving people\\'s health and wellbeing on a physical and a mental basis,\" he said. \"That\\'s the bit that really makes me tick.\"\\n\\nMr Hounsfield admits to being worried what the reaction would be.\\n\\n\"Some of my friends are seasoned environmental campaigners, I was quite worried about building something quite artificial like this, as though it would somehow devalue it,\" he said.\\n\\n\"But all of them categorically say we cannot wait for the wave to be open because it will be the perfect classroom for us to be able to get that message out there in a really engaging way.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Javi Munoz Image caption Long-time surfer Nick Hounsfield believes in the mental and physical health benefits of the sport\\n\\nMr Hounsfield continued: \"Particularly because this is inland, there is a real disconnect between people who are living in cities, and maybe don\\'t understand the impact of what they are doing day-to-day and the choices that they are making are having on the coastal environment - from what we flush down the toilet to our choices in single-use plastics.\"\\n\\nThe site has been built using as few toxic chemicals as possible. The buildings are timber-clade and insulated with sustainable wood fibre. They\\'re also fitted with solar thermal panels that pre-heat water to reduce energy use. There are also plans to build infrastructure to allow the site to generate its own power.\\n\\nChief executive Craig Stoddart says it\\'s costing an extra £100,000 a year to use renewable energy. \"The idea of helping to acidify the ocean where natural waves come from, that\\'s crazy - why would you do that?

Also for older people, to give them space to be in a natural environment.\"\\n\\nIt was constructed within the green belt on former farmland which, according to Mr Richardson, was \"low in diversity and ecology.\"\\n\\n\"We needed to look at where the lake was and how it fitted in to the landscape. What we could do with all the soil that came out; how we could use it to improve biodiversity and habitat,\" he said.\\n\\nImage copyright Image Cabin Image caption The plan is for the UK team to train here for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics - when surfing becomes an Olympic sport\\n\\nThe Wave is in part of the Avon Forest conservation area. \"I am very much of the mindset of looking at the wider context. Rather than creating a pocket of ecology, I wanted to connect it with the wider network of habitat corridors like hedgerows and nearby woodland, to allow flora and fauna to spread,\" Mr Richardson added.\\n\\nThe commitment to provide a connection with nature extends in to the lake itself. In the ocean, waves can form thousands of miles from where they break on land. They are born when wind moves over the surface of the water, stirring up ripples which grow in to a swell. A swell is essentially a moving band of energy, forged into a complex, shifting shape that peaks and breaks when it reaches shallower water.\\n\\nThe kind of wave you get depends on that sea bed, and the bottom of the Wave pool has been designed to mimic those that crash over coral reefs, known as \"reef breaks.\" This means it\\'s as close to a natural ocean wave as physics is currently able to generate.\\n\\nMr Hounsfield started the project with practically no money. \"Everything from finding the land, to getting planning permission, to the massive hurdle of getting the financing. That took two-and-a-half years of \\'Dragons Den\\' style meetings,\" he said.\\n\\nCritics say that the regular, identical waves produced by surf lakes give people a false sense of security in the ocean. Some surfers also believe that it will lead to popular breaks becoming overcrowded.\\n\\nMr Hounsfield says that while it\\'s possible there could be more surfers, they will understand the sport much better, be more environmentally aware - and be safer in the water. For example, they will teach people how to get out of dangerous rip currents.\\n\\nEither way, surf lakes are here to stay.

And why do the 5 Live Boxing pundits believe Price can upset the bookmakers?\\n\\nShades, title and chin talk\\n\\nScotland\\'s Taylor - unbeaten in 15 fights - has been hyped every inch of the way to landing the IBF world super-lightweight title last time out.\\n\\nTall, rangy, classy and with plenty of grit, he appears made for unified champion status if he can take the WBA belt held by Prograis, who has 24 wins in as many outings.\\n\\nPrograis, 30, starts a slight favourite at 8-13 with bookmakers but has never faced the hostility that can come from fighting outside his own country.\\n\\nHowever, British fight fans have seen how well-schooled Americans can wreak havoc on these shores before, notably when Terence Crawford stunned Taylor\\'s compatriot Ricky Burns in Glasgow to land a first world title in 2014.\\n\\nCrawford would go on to become one of the most decorated fighters of modern times. The threat to Taylor is obvious and the motivation of what could be for Prograis is huge.\\n\\nTaylor told BBC Sport: \"Regis thinks he\\'s a bit of a superstar - he\\'s a bit of a show pony, coming here to a news conference with his shades on. It\\'s raining outside. I don\\'t know what it is but there is something about him that makes me want to take his chin off.\\n\\n\"He\\'s an away fighter; he will be getting a big shock on Saturday. It might get to him a little bit. I can tell he is nervous when I look in his eyes.\"\\n\\nIf a shot at two belts and the future opportunities a win presents is not enough, the winner will also claim the World Boxing Super Series trophy for 2019.\\n\\nPundits\\' split call - analysis\\n\\nBBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello: I am seeing this as a genuine 50-50. I am leaning very slightly to Prograis for the simple fact I think there is a little bit more that\\'s different about him and I think there is more than one way he can win.\\n\\nI do think it\\'s a really difficult fight to call, as difficult as any in 2019.\\n\\nBBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce: Both of these can drop or stop the other. But I think this is a fight decided on intelligence, rather than power. I am going just the other way around. If Taylor can survive the best Prograis has to throw at him, I can see him getting home on a tight call.\\n\\nA bad smell and show me the money\\n\\nWhile Taylor and Prograis will sweat down to 10st, Chisora expects a heavyweight brawl and simply says it will be \"bombs away\" when the bell goes against Price.\\n\\nChisora, 35, was meant to face Joseph Parker, only for the New Zealand fighter to fall ill after being bitten by a spider.\\n\\nIt left 2008 Olympic bronze medallist Price an opening to build on a run of three wins in a row and presents the chance to move to the outskirts of conversations linking him with the biggest names in the division.\\n\\nIt is the chance for a rebirth for 36-year-old Price, who faced ridicule after defeats in recent years and admits he felt a \"relief\" when he decided he would retire following defeat to Christian Hammer in 2017. Retirement never came and he says a falling bank balance kept him fighting.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a stressful journey but I am proud,\" Price told BBC Sport.\\n\\n\"I have stuck at it, persevered - a lot of people would have thrown their hand in, especially with the criticism I have had. I have hung around alike a bad smell for some people and that\\'s why it\\'s nice to shove it in their faces again. I do believe I am coming into my peak.\\n\\n\"This opportunity for me is massive. The upside is beyond what I thought was even possible six or 18 months ago. So it was a no brainer in the end.\"\\n\\nPrice has previously sparred countless rounds with Chisora - who starts a 1-4 favourite - and in his own words, will face \"a bruiser of a man\".\\n\\nChisora meanwhile, will need to bring pressure to bear on his opponent given he stands almost seven inches shorter than Price.\\n\\nMeanwhile, he says the prospect of a world-title shot is secondary to financial goals.\\n\\n\"I\\'m a bit worried about this fight to be honest,\" said Chisora, who last fought for a world title in 2012. \"It\\'s a worrying fight for me right now.\\n\\n\"Winning a world title and retiring with no money doesn\\'t mean anything for me. I want the money, man. I want shows where I get paid and secure the future for my family.\\n\\n\"There are so many fighters who are world title holders, some are my friends, and they have no money. I don\\'t want to be that guy. I want to make the money.\"\\n\\n\\'Price will win again\\' - Analysis\\n\\nMike Costello: There\\'s a guessing game around Price. Has the win over Dave Allen given him the confidence surge that might make all the difference?\\n\\nWe know in the past that nervous energy has cost him - he has weakened so quickly during a contest. Against Allen it was so controlled. I know Allen is not Chisora, and Chisora has all that experience, but I think the boxing ability of Price is still there.\\n\\nMaybe now, finally, he is beginning to become a proper professional boxer. I am genuinely excited at the prospect of this fight.\\n\\nSteve Bunce: Price boxing with confidence can beat just about any version of Chisora.\\n\\nChisora is one of the most remarkable boxers in recent British history. His record defies belief. He walks out and keeps reinventing his history. I think it\\'s a really hard fight, a fun fight, and I think Price will win again, I really do.', 'Media playback is not supported on this device England can\\'t be \\'spectators\\' against New Zealand - Eddie Jones\\n\\nRugby World Cup semi-final: England v New Zealand Venue: International Stadium, Yokohama Date: Saturday, 26 October Kick-off: 09:00 BST Coverage: Full commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live, plus text updates on the BBC Sport website and app.\\n\\nEngland will dethrone defending champions New Zealand in their Rugby World Cup semi-final if their key players deliver, says Matt Dawson.\\n\\nNew Zealand have won 15 of their past 16 meetings with England and all three of their previous World Cup encounters.\\n\\nBut former England scrum-half Dawson believes Eddie Jones\\' side have the ability to upset the odds.\\n\\n\"England have some world-class players. If that group play to their best, England will win,\" he told BBC 5 Live.\\n\\n\"It starts with individual performance. The front row, Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell are world class. Billy Vunipola, Ben Youngs, Manu Tuilagi and Elliot Daly must step up to that level.

But he and Jones are paid the money to coach a side and make those big calls. Scott Barrett\\'s inclusion is specifically for how New Zealand want to play. It gives them a bit more bulk.\\n\\n\"Perhaps Hansen feels England have the edge in the set-piece and wanted a bit more bulk.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a huge weekend for all sports fans.

In a separate statement on Friday, the force said: “As our investigations continue, the picture may change regarding identification.”\\n\\nWhile the police have not yet confirmed the identities of those in the trailer, the family’s fears highlight the difficulties in obtaining information on trafficked individuals.\\n\\nIn the message to her mother, feared to have been sent in her final moments, the 26-year-old wrote that she was struggling to breathe and apologised.\\n\\nThe message, translated into English by a family acquaintance, was received at 4.28am on Wednesday morning in Vietnam, a screenshot shows. This would have been 10.28pm UK time, when the trailer carrying the victims would have been in transit – and just four hours before the ambulance was called and the bodies were discovered.\\n\\nIn messages from an account nicknamed ‘daughter’, Phạm wrote: “I’m sorry Mum. My journey abroad hasn’t succeeded. Mum, I love you so much! I’m dying because I can’t breathe ... I’m from Nghèn, Can Lộc, Hà Tĩnh, Vietnam ... I am sorry, Mum.” One message has been blanked out because it mentioned the family’s address.\\n\\nThe screenshot also shows that Phạm has not accessed the account since Wednesday.\\n\\nA screenshot of Phạm’s last text, posted with permission from her family’s contact. Photograph: Supplied\\n\\nThe Vietnamese Embassy in London confirmed it has contacted police in regard to a missing woman feared to be one of the 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex.\\n\\nA spokesman for the embassy said they had been contacted by a family in Vietnam which claimed their daughter had been missing “since the lorry was found”.\\n\\nThe spokesman said: “We have contacted Essex Police and we are waiting for an answer.”\\n\\nTrafficked migrants are rarely on any kind of formal manifesto and victims’ families may in some cases be in danger themselves if they acknowledge their disappearance. They may also fear that by going public they will put their loved one at risk of arrest if they are in fact still alive.\\n\\nMimi Vu, a leading expert on trafficking of Vietnamese young people to Europe and the UK, said the texts appeared to be authentic. “She writes her name and where she is from, which is very important, to tell people where she should be buried. It is important for the body to be returned to the place of birth,” said Vu, who has been working in Vietnam on trafficking and slavery issues for the past seven years.\\n\\nVu noted that occasionally people were given false Chinese passports, if they were trafficked through China, which could lead to confusion.\\n\\nFollowing Phạm’s disappearance, her brother posted a message on a forum regularly used by Vietnamese people looking for missing relatives.\\n\\nHe wrote that Phạm, who lived in the Nghèn township in Can Lộc district, left the rural province of Hà Tĩnh in northern Vietnam on 3 October before travelling to the capital, Hanoi, to “finalize her papers to go China”.\\n\\nShe then flew to France and on to the UK, he said. However, she was allegedly arrested on arrival in the UK before being sent back to France.\\n\\nIn the post, her brother added: “She was arrested a few days ago by UK police and they returned her to France. Now we heard that she might have died. I am posting to ask for her whereabout and if you tell me your projection about her situation.”\\n\\nHoa Nghiem, a coordinator at Human Rights Space, a civic network based in Vietnam, said she had spoken with a lawyer who was trying to help the family.\\n\\nShe said: “The girl’s family got in touch with the lawyer – who has dealt with cases like this before – asking if she could help. They are desperate for any information about their daughter.\\n\\n“They just want any updates and have been posting on forums and speaking to the lawyer about getting help.”\\n\\nNghiem said she knew of at least six Vietnamese families who were concerned that their relatives were among the 39 people found dead in the refrigerated container.\\n\\n“They lost contact with their family members who were travelling to the UK through China. They were worried if their family members could be in the truck,” she added.\\n\\nThree of the families, all with missing sons – one born in 2004 – had been sent word that their loved ones would shortly arrive in Britain. “They said they received information that their family members were about to reach the UK on October 23, that they should be prepared to pay. But then the contact disappeared,” Nghiem said.\\n\\nThe province of Hà Tĩnh is a hotspot for trafficking, with many immigrants travelling into China first obtaining a Chinese passport and then travelling on to Europe.\\n\\n“I understand that we are getting to know more and more about similar situations. The province is known for sending people illegally to Britain. When they get to China they then travel on from there,” added Nghiem.\\n\\nVietnam was the country with the third highest number of suspected victims of modern slavery in the UK in 2018, as identified by the national referral mechanism (NRM), the official framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive the appropriate protection and support.\\n\\nThere were 702 Vietnamese modern slavery victims referred last year, behind 947 Albanians and 1,625 UK nationals.\\n\\nA 2012 government report assessing human trafficking routes highlighted a journey from Vietnam to UK that passed through China, Russia and northern or western Europe.', 'Growing demand for SUVs was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2018, a new analysis has found.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn that period, SUVs doubled their global market share from 17% to 39% and their annual emissions rose to more than 700 megatonnes of CO2, more than the yearly total emissions of the UK and the Netherlands combined.\\n\\nNo energy sector except power drove a larger increase in carbon emissions, putting SUVs ahead of heavy industry (including iron, steel, cement and aluminium), aviation and shipping.\\n\\n“We were quite surprised by this result ourselves,” said Laura Cozzi, the chief energy modeller of the International Energy Agency, which produced the report.\\n\\nThe recent dramatic shift towards heavier SUVs has offset both efficiency improvements in smaller cars and carbon savings from electric vehicles.\\n\\nAs the global fleet of SUVs has grown, its emissions have increased more than fourfold in just eight years. If SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions.\\n\\n“An SUV is bigger, it’s heavier, the aerodynamics are poor, so as a result you get more CO2,” said Florent Grelier from the campaign group Transport & Environment.\\n\\nT&E figures show the average mass of new cars rose 10% between 2000 and 2016, which the group suggested could be down to a trend towards SUVs, heavier automatic and dual-clutch gearboxes and the inclusion of other equipment including cameras and sensors.\\n\\nGrelier said the global shift towards bigger cars had been observed for a while, but the effect on emissions increases compared to other industries was surprising nonetheless.\\n\\n“The problem is much bigger than we expected,” he said.\\n\\nSUV sales are growing despite overall stagnation in the car market Global passenger car sales Source: IEA\\n\\nThe global car market has been stalling in recent years, which analysts have attributed to the escalating China–US trade war and the sluggish performance of the Chinese economy in general.\\n\\nThe SUV segment has so far bucked this trend however, with a record 35m vehicles sold in 2018.\\n\\nThe IEA figures show that SUVs steadily increased their share across major markets all around the world, from Europe and the US to China and India.\\n\\nCozzi said this was another surprise: “We thought this was a trend that was more concentrated in a few countries … but it’s becoming really universal.”\\n\\nIn the US, nearly one in two passenger cars sold today is an SUV.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe IEA’s definition of “SUV” covers a range of cars from crossovers to off-road vehicles. Popular models in the UK include the Nissan Qashqai, Hyundai Tucson and Land Rover Range Rover.\\n\\nThe emissions analysis considered only the carbon produced from fuel combustion, not any emissions embedded in the manufacturing of the cars – where larger models are also likely to result in more emissions.\\n\\nSUVs started to become popular in the 1980s, and often earned nicknames such as “Chelsea Tractor” as a result of the wealthy city suburbs they became associated with. Since then, sales have continued to rise, and the vehicles are often marketed as a status symbol.\\n\\nHowever, opposition to SUVs in cities is also rising. Berlin recently saw protests demanding a ban on the vehicles after a driver hit and killed four pedestrians, while in Frankfurt activists protested against the climate impact of the vehicles at a trade show. SUVs are significantly more likely to kill pedestrians in crashes, and although they are often marketed as safer, people driving them are 11% more likely to die in a crash than people in normal cars.\\n\\nCozzi said a number of factors were driving demand for bigger cars. While perceptions of heightened safety or increased social status could play a role at the individual level, she also pointed towards manufacturers’ changing offering.\\n\\nShe said the difficult market situation led carmakers to look for the most profitable models in their ranges.\\n\\n“There is a really big need for car manufacturers to find the margins wherever it is possible, and the SUV segment seems to be one of those places,” she said.\\n\\nIn the UK, the transport sector overtook energy generation as the number one source of greenhouse gas emissions in 2016.\\n\\nAccording to Guardian analysis of DfT statistics, there are about five million licensed SUVs in the UK today.\\n\\nThe UK government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040, although hybrid models would be exempt under the plan.\\n\\nThe Committee on Climate Change, the government’s independent adviser, says the ban should be brought forward to 2035 and include hybrid cars.\\n\\nEU-wide, electric vehicles made up only 2% of new cars sold last year, but a recent report from Transport & Environment suggests that figure could reach 10% by 2021.\\n\\nThis is due in part to EU emissions targets, phased in from next year, which will put much stricter limits on the average emissions of each manufacturer’s newly registered cars.\\n\\nExperts are stressing that quick decarbonisation of the transport sector will also require a reduction in the total number of passenger cars on the road, particularly in big cities.\\n\\n“We need to keep less and less space for cars so that it’s more convenient for people to use other means of transportation, whether it’s walking, cycling or public transport,” Grelier said.', 'Offer is now expected to be made only days before UK is due to leave EU on 31 October\\n\\nThe EU is delaying its decision on the length of the next Brexit extension until next Monday or Tuesday after France insisted on waiting until after a vote on Boris Johnson’s demand for a pre-Christmas general election.\\n\\nDuring a meeting of EU diplomats, the French ambassador stood alone in arguing that it was not the right time to agree a three-month delay.\\n\\nOnly after the vote on Monday should the EU decide to “go short, to push for ratification, or long to privilege a general election”, the ambassador told the other member states.\\n\\nThe prevarication in Brussels will leave the issue of an extension in doubt with as little as 48 hours to go before the UK is due to leave.\\n\\nEU sources said that the chances of leaders being called to a summit to decide the issue had risen. “It has not been ruled out at all,” a source said.\\n\\nThe 26 other member states are understood to have argued that France was playing a dangerous game by “playing ping-pong with the UK and reacting to every twist and turn”. “Let’s take a step back,” one diplomat said.\\n\\nThe delay is politically difficult for Jeremy Corbyn, who had said Labour would only vote in favour of a general election if the EU confirmed it would grant an extension to 31 January, taking a no-deal Brexit off the table. The prime minister reacted to the latest developments by calling for the Labour leader to “man up”.\\n\\nAfter the two-hour meeting in Brussels on Friday, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, had conceded that an “excellent” discussion had concluded without any clear way forward. “No decision,” he said.\\n\\nAn EU source said of the meeting of EU27 ambassadors: “There was full agreement on the need for an extension. There was full agreement to reach a unanimous, consensual EU27 decision. And there was full agreement to aim to take the decision by written procedure … Work will continue over the weekend.”\\n\\nThe diplomatic source added that EU27 diplomats were “expected to meet early next week to finalise an agreement” and that the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, had “no intention” of calling a summit.\\n\\nA majority of member states want to accept the terms of an extension reluctantly requested by Johnson under which Brexit could be delayed until 31 January, but with the opportunity to leave earlier if the withdrawal agreement was ratified in Westminster and by the European parliament.\\n\\nQuick guide How can Boris Johnson get a general election before January? Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\\n\\nThose terms had been due to be signed off on Friday. “There is one country standing in the way – France,” a diplomat said. “Everyone is very frustrated. They were told that a short extension ran the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit.”\\n\\n“It is the French, always the French,” said a second senior diplomat. “And they never back down.”\\n\\nSources suggested that France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, was keen to appear helpful to Downing Street and keep the pressure on MPs.\\n\\nAs a result, if there is no general election, there remains the possibility that the EU will offer a shorter delay, to mid or late November, merely to allow time for ratification, although sources suggested this remained unlikely. “We agreed we all want to avoid a no deal – and a short extension will just raise the possibility,” said an EU source.\\n\\nBy meddling with the terms of the extension request laid out in the Benn act, the prime minister would also be placed under a different set of obligations. If the three-month extension to 31 January is offered, Johnson will have to agree to it. A different formulation would require parliament to pass a motion endorsing the extension request. Johnson would then need to formally agree to it with the EU by 30 October or within 48 hours, depending on which is earlier.', 'Dancers do it, Instagrammers do it, even the Venus de Milo does it. When it comes to striking a pose, it seems the only way is contrapposto. Now research has shed light on why the attitude is so appealing.\\n\\nExperts say the pose, which involves standing with weight predominantly on one foot with a slight twist in the upper body, makes the waist-to-hip ratio appear strikingly low on one side of the body.\\n\\nA low waist-to-hip ratio – reflecting an hourglass shape – has previously been linked to attractiveness and impressions of fertility and health in women.\\n\\n“We think that artists have intuitively figured out that this posture is more attractive, and applied it in their artistic endeavours,” said Dr Farid Pazhoohi, now based at the University of British Columbia, Canada.\\n\\nWhile research has suggested a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is deemed most attractive in real women, studies have suggested the most popular imaginary women have even lower ratios – in particular a very small waist – a finding that might help to explain the appeal of characters such as Betty Boop and Jessica Rabbit.\\n\\nNow researchers have shown that both a woman’s pose and the angle from which they are seen can alter their apparent waist-to-hip ratio – potentially explaining why the contrapposto stance is so popular.\\n\\nAlthough contrapposto is also often used by men – not least Michelangelo’s David – the study did not explore the impact on how their ratio appeared, or how others might respond to it.\\n\\nWriting in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, Pazhooi and colleagues report how they created 3D avatars of a woman standing up straight and contrapposto, with the body cropped from the shoulders to the knee.\\n\\nEach pose was shown from eight different angles. Looking across the body, the waist-to-hip ratio was similar for both poses at all angles. But when left and right sides of the body were considered separately there was a difference. For the standing-straight pose, the left and right waist-to-hip ratios were similar for all angles, except side-on, but for the contrapposto pose the ratio was always far lower on one side of the body than the other.\\n\\nThe team showed the images to a total of 68 heterosexual university students, 25 men and 43 women, and asked them to rate how attractive they found them. In addition the team tracked participants’ eye movements as they looked at the images.\\n\\nThe results show that men rated the images as more attractive than women, but both sexes rated the contrapposto pose overall as more attractive than standing up straight.\\n\\nFurther analysis showed the results to be driven by particular angles of the contrapposto pose proving more attractive than the comparable standing pose – including the front-on view, back-view and the woman facing diagonally away from the the viewer.\\n\\nThe eye-tracking data showed for almost all angles of the standing-up-straight pose, both men and women spent about the same length of time looking at the left and right side of the avatar. However for almost all of the contrapposto angles they spent longer looking at one side – the side with the lower waist-to-hip ratio – while their eyes flew to this side first, and more often. In other words, edges that looked curvier grabbed their attention.\\n\\nThe study has limitations, including that it did not consider differences in how the figure’s breasts appeared in the different images.\\n\\nHowever the team suggest the low waist-to-hip ratio produced on one side when standing in a contrapposto pose, and its contrast with the high ratio on the other side, makes a woman stand out from the crowd and appear more attractive.\\n\\nThey even suggest the findings may explain why certain movements, gaits and even dance moves in women are deemed more attractive.\\n\\n“For example, when models do catwalk or dancers do belly dancing, they try to appear frequently in exaggerated contrapposto body forms, including lower than 0.7, and people consider these movements very attractive,” said Pazhoohi. “Similarly, when women walk on high heels, it helps accentuate the contrapposto form.”', \"Newly released video shows a Fresno, California, police officer shooting a fleeing, unarmed 16-year-old in the back of the head and then handcuffing the boy as he lies motionless on the ground.\\n\\nSurveillance footage of the 14 April 2017 killing of Isiah Murrietta-Golding, released this week by the family’s attorney, has spread across the US, with critics calling it another example of extreme police brutality and unjustified lethal force that would have received little attention if lawyers hadn’t published the video.\\n\\nThe footage shows the teenager running from officers, jumping a fence, falling to the ground and continuing to flee. Murrietta-Golding was an estimated 35 feet away from the officers when one of them fired a single bullet into his head. The officer then hopped the fence, approached the boy’s limp body and handcuffed his hands behind his back.\\n\\nThe video comes after the police department in Fresno, a city in California’s Central Valley, refused to release the footage while publicly stating that the killing was “justified”, said Stuart Chandler, an attorney for Murrietta-Golding’s father.\\n\\n“The city was so adamant that the officer ‘feared for his life’,” the lawyer told the Guardian on Thursday. “Why were they hiding the video? If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the video speaks a million words.”\\n\\nThe aftermath of the shooting caught on video was especially upsetting to watch, the attorney added.\\n\\n“He’s unconscious and in the process of dying. What is the threat?” said Chandler. “They just saw him as an animal who had been shot. They hunted a target. It’s inhumane.”\\n\\nA paramedic report showed that police declined to remove the handcuffs when an EMT arrived, with an officer saying police would only take them off later at the hospital.\\n\\nJerry Dyer, the Fresno police chief at the time of the shooting, has previously stated that the officer, Sgt Ray Villalvazo, thought “he was about to be shot”. Dyer claimed the teen “reached into his waistband several times”, according to the Fresno Bee. But the new footage, which Chandler obtained in the process of a civil lawsuit against the department, only shows him running away as he appears to be holding up his pants. He was unarmed.\\n\\nFresno’s current police chief, Andrew Hall, continued to defend the shooting as a justified use of deadly force in a statement this week, saying Murrietta-Golding was “known to carry firearms” and noting that he had entered a daycare center when he hopped the fence.\\n\\nFootage of California police killing unarmed teen prompts claim of 'trigger-happy' officers Read more\\n\\nHall further alleged that Murrietta-Golding was involved in a crime the previous day.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Fresno police department did not respond to an inquiry seeking clarification on the firearms allegation and the use of handcuffs.\\n\\nAccording to the family’s suit, police were trying to question Murrietta-Golding, but lacked a search or arrest warrant, so officers staked out his house then pulled him over in a car with two other teens and “held them at gunpoint”. At that point, he fled.\\n\\nLawyers for the family noted that the shooting happened on a Saturday while the daycare center was empty. And Chandler said it was “despicable” that police were still trying to attack Murrietta-Golding’s character, saying the allegations and insinuations about what had happened prior were not relevant to the officer’s decision to kill the boy as he fled.\\n\\nThe shooting happened nine months after Fresno police killed Dylan Noble, shooting the unarmed 19-year-old multiple times, including while he was lying on the ground, barely moving. Advocates have long argued that Fresno police need to focus on de-escalation and anti-bias training, and a 2017 American Civil Liberties Union report found that police shoot people of color at a hugely disproportionate rate in the city.\\n\\nChandler faulted Fresno police for failing to implement meaningful reforms after both killings of unarmed teens.\\n\\n“There has been no change in either the culture, the training or the mentality regarding the use of deadly force.”\\n\\nThe state of California recently passed a major reform meant to limit the use of lethal force by police, with a law considered the strictest in the country.\", 'A senior coroner hearing the inquest of a soldier who collapsed and died during a fitness test on a searingly hot day in the Brecon Beacons has strongly criticised the army for not learning from mistakes made during a previous tragedy when three men died during an SAS trial.\\n\\nCpl Joshua Hoole, 26, collapsed near the end of an eight-mile course in south Wales in July 2016, three years after three army reservists suffered fatal heat illness in the same area while they took part in the SAS march on a very hot day.\\n\\nGiving her conclusions, the coroner Louise Hunt said a string of “very serious failings” had meant the annual fitness test (AFT) in which Hoole was taking part was not safe. She said she believed the march should not have gone ahead because of the heat and concluded that the safety assessment carried out was not fit for purpose.\\n\\nHunt highlighted that of the 41 corporals and lance corporals taking part in the AFT only 24 completed it, with many complaining of the heat being magnified because it was held in by the hedges lining the lanes in which they were moving with full pack and rifle. One said it felt hotter than Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe coroner said another soldier, who collapsed before Hoole died, should have been recognised as a casualty of the heat – which ought to have led to the AFT being halted. In fact, those in charge of the AFT thought he had an ankle injury. The soldier was told later in hospital he could have died if he had not stopped.\\n\\nOfficer in fatal march says he lacked health and safety training Read more\\n\\nHunt said there had been a “very serious failing” by the army to make sure the training team that ran the test was aware of a crucial document called JSP 539, which relates to climatic illness and was featured repeatedly during the SAS inquest.\\n\\nThe coroner said she had issued a report intended to prevent further deaths at the conclusion of the SAS inquest in 2015, and specifically raised concern about issues including the lack of awareness about JSP 539 and risk assessments.\\n\\nShe said: “The failure of the army to learn from previous mistakes is a very concerning matter for me.” She said she would write another report on preventing further deaths to the defence secretary.\\n\\nHunt added: “It leaves me very worried about the army’s ability to learn from previous mistakes. It’s a matter of grave concern to me that I’m raising the same concerns. I want to give a message to the army that they need to think about how to learn. Quite simply, something has to change.”\\n\\nThe coroner said the AFT should not have gone ahead at all because when the trial began at about 7am the temperature would have been above 20C – the point at which such exercises should not take place. “The AFT should not have gone ahead,” she said. “Josh would not have died when he did if the AFT had not gone ahead.”\\n\\nShe also said a crucial piece of kit called the wet bulb globe thermometer, which takes factors such as heat, humidity and wind into account when producing a reading, had been placed in the shade and so did not give an accurate reading. “The risk assessment for the AFT was not fit for purpose. It did not address the very real risk of heat illness,” she said.\\n\\nAfter Hoole’s death, a defence service inquiry report concluded that he died not because of the heat but due to an undiagnosed underlying medical condition. But his father, Phillip Hoole, rejected that conclusion and when he investigated the circumstances of the AFT came to believe there had been serious organisational failings in how the exercise was run. He successfully campaigned for a full and detailed inquest.\\n\\nHoole, who represented himself and his family, argued that the coroner should have concluded that his son had been the victim of unlawful killing and called for the Crown Prosecution Service to launch a corporate manslaughter investigation.\\n\\nRecording a narrative conclusion, the coroner said she could not consider a verdict of unlawful killing. Hunt concluded that “heat stress” was one of a number of factors that led to Hoole’s death, although she said it was not the sole factor and he also had an underlying heart condition.\\n\\nRelatives of two of the soldiers who died in the SAS trial in 2013 were in court in Birmingham to hear the coroner’s conclusions.', \"The UK government has considered options for repatriating British members of the Islamic State being held in prison camps in northern Syria, it has emerged.\\n\\nThe information was disclosed during the hearing into the home secretary’s decision to remove Shamima Begum’s citizenship, the former Bethnal Green schoolgirl who travelled to Syria at the age of 15.\\n\\nBut that contradicts a previous assertion by the government that it had no way of getting British Isis fighters, their wives and children out of Syria.\\n\\nThe government document, referred to at the tribunal, was dated 4 April 2019 and headed “options for extracting British nationals from Syrian IDP camps” – a reference to internally displaced persons.\\n\\nTom Hickman QC, for Begum said the document stated that: “While difficult, the practical challenges in arranging and implementing an extraction are likely to have solutions.”\\n\\nForeign Office minister Andrew Murrison repeated this week that “the UK has no consular presence in Syria from which to provide assistance.”\\n\\nHe has promised to “do all we can for unaccompanied minors and orphans” but that leaves children with parents in the camps in a legal limbo.\\n\\nThis week a Human Rights Watch report stated that there are 30 British women and 60 British children detained by Kurdish authorities in north-east Syria.\\n\\nAccording to the report the children are all below the age of 12 and a “significant majority” are younger than five years old, with the “vast majority” detained with their mothers.\\n\\nThree British orphans, Amira, 10, Heba, eight, and Hamza, six, were taken from the Ain Issa camp to Raqqa, along with 24 other orphans, in the face of a Turkish incursion into Syria, and are being cared for by the Save the Children charity.\\n\\nShamima Begum faces 'extreme scenario' in citizenship appeal Read more\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch said the Roj camp, where Begum is held, and the al-Hawl camp, where she was previously held, remain under the control of the Kurdish authorities and outside of the proposed Turkish buffer zone.\\n\\nThe campaign group said there were no active hostilities between the Kurds and Turkey near these camps and the route out of north-east Syria to Iraq is currently still held by the Kurdish authority.\\n\\nJonathan Glasson QC, for the home secretary, told the hearing of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) that even if Begum succeeds in having her citizenship reinstated, her “detention will be unaffected”.\\n\\nProfile Shamima Begum's journey into Isis Show Hide February 2015 At the age of 15, Shamima Begum flees her home in Bethnal Green, east London. She travels with schoolfriends Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana. The three intend to meet another friend, Sharmeena Begum – no relation of Shamima – who had travelled to Syria in late 2014. CCTV footage shows the girls walking through Gatwick airport, where they boarded a flight to Turkey. There they are picked up by smugglers and taken across the border to an Isis base in northern Syria. Once there they move into a women’s house in Raqqa and apply to marry. July 2015 The families of the girls say that two of them have married Isis fighters, without disclosing which. They say they are distraught at the news. It later emerges that Begum had married 27-year-old Yago Riedijk, an Isis fighter from the Netherlands, 10 days after arriving in Raqqa. Soon afterwards she became pregnant with her first child, a daughter named Sarayah. July 2016 Abase marries an 18-year-old Australian jihadist, Abdullah Elmir. He was later reported by intelligence agencies to have been killed by a coalition airstrike. August 2016 Sultana’s family say that they believe she had been killed in an airstrike in Raqqa in May 2016. January 2017 Begum and her family flee Raqqa as Isis retreats and head south-east to the town of Mayadin. She has another child, a son called Jerah. Later, the family moves again as Isis is pushed back. June 2018 Begum sees her two surviving classmates, Sharmeena Begum and Abase, for the last time. Late 2018 Jerah dies, aged eight months, of malnutrition and an unknown illness. Her daughter dies soon after, aged one year and nine months. February 2019 Begum, who is heavily pregnant, gives an interview to the Times, in which she says that she should be allowed to return to the UK to raise her unborn third child. She gives birth a few days later. The Home Office tells her family that her citizenship will be revoked. March 2019 Jarrah, Begum's new born son, dies in a Syrian refugee camp. The child was three weeks old.\\n\\nPhotograph: POOL New/X80003\\n\\n“Even if her appeal succeeds it could not result in her return,” he said. “Her treatment is the same as British citizens who have not been deprived.”\\n\\nGlasson said the government accepts that the situation in Syria is “fluid and volatile” and Begum cannot give live evidence or make a witness statement.\\n\\nBut he added that should not prevent the home secretary from removing her citizenship, adding: “The more committed and extreme an individual is, the more likely they would find themselves in a situation where they were less able to participate in proceedings and so less likely to be the subject of deprivation and that cannot possibly be right.”\\n\\nBegum left Britain in February 2015 when she was 15, with two friends from the Bethnal Green Academy in east London, using her older sister’s passport.\\n\\nIn Syria, Begum married an Isis fighter and the couple had three children, all three of whom died of disease or malnutrition, the last in a prison camp in northern Syria.\\n\\nShe was stripped of her British citizenship on the grounds of national security in February, amid a political row over whether she was a dual British and Bangladeshi citizen.\\n\\nBut under UN conventions signed after the second world war, making a person stateless is unlawful.\\n\\nNow in the Roj Camp, Begum has appealed to come home, saying: “I hate the Dawla [Isis] so much.”\\n\\nThe SIAC hearing continues.

The amber warning for Wales begins from 6pm on Friday, and lasts until 11am on Saturday.\\n\\nThe first widespread frost of the season is also anticipated during the weekend, as a burst of polar maritime air brings colder temperatures to northern parts of Britain on Saturday, before hitting the rest of the country on Sunday and into next week.\\n\\nAreas where that cold air met the warmer air would receive the heaviest rainfall, said Maxey. “Because of the colder air, there’s a possibility that some of the rain may fall as snow, but only over very high ground in the north,” she said. “You might see a dusting on top of the Pennines, and you may see a centimetre or two over the mountains in Scotland.”\\n\\nThe northern half of the country should expect temperatures in the high single-figures at the weekend, with southern parts anticipated to experience slightly warmer conditions in the low double-figures – temperatures that are typical for this time of year.\\n\\nMaxey said: “It’s been relatively mild, so this will be the first cold weather of the season.”', '15:07\\n\\nBarbara Van Gelder, lawyer for White House official, Tim Morrison, just sent the Guardian this line: “If subpoenaed, Mr. Morrison plans to appear for his deposition.

In Chile, a hike in the metro fare and rampant inequality. In Hong Kong, an extradition bill and creeping authoritarianism. In Algeria, a fifth term for an ageing president and decades of military rule.\\n\\nThe protests raging today and in the past months on the streets of cities around the world have varying triggers. But the fuel is familiar: stagnating middle classes, stifled democracy and the bone-deep conviction that things can be different – even if the alternative is not always clear.\\n\\nFew corners of the world have been spared significant protests in 2019. Russia, Serbia, Ukraine and Albania have all seen major demonstrations. So have the UK, against Brexit, France, with its yellow vest movement, and Spain, in the restive region of Catalonia. The Middle East has convulsed with so much dissent that some are calling it a second wave of the Arab spring. In South America, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela have experienced popular unrest. The list goes on.\\n\\nAn explosion of protest, a howl of rage – but not a Latin American spring Read more\\n\\n“The data shows that the amount of protests is increasing and is as high as the roaring 60s, and has been since about 2009,” says Jacquelien van Stekelenburg, a professor who studies social change and conflict at Vrije University in Amsterdam.\\n\\nNot all the protests are driven by economic complaints, but widening gulfs between the haves and have-nots are radicalising many young people in particular. Oxfam said in January that the world’s 26 richest individuals owned as much wealth as the poorest half of the global population. Billionaires grew their combined fortunes by $2.5bn a day in 2018, while the relative wealth of the world’s poorest 3.8 billion people declined by $500m a day.\\n\\nThousands of people have joined rolling Extinction Rebellion protests at the lack of action on the climate crisis by leaders content to leave the problem to the next generation.\\n\\nThe internet is not a determining factor – there was no social media in the 1960s – but is clearly important. Social media and the explosion of access to information is reordering hierarchies of knowledge and communication. Authorities can fight back with extensive surveillance regimes or with digital blackouts of the kind India recently imposed in disputed Kashmir, but 20th-century power structures are under enormous pressure, analysts say.\\n\\n“The traditional system of enforcing power from top to bottom is increasingly being challenged,” says Thierry de Montbrial, of the French Institute of International Relations. “There is a social revolution with a growing demand for participatory democracy.”\\n\\nIt is also easier, in a digital, globalised world, to know how the other half (or the 1%) live. “There are not just new streams of information, but streams of people,” says van Stekelenburg. “Those youngsters in the Arab spring in all likelihood knew at least one person living overseas, and it creates a kind of relative deprivation – ‘I want to have that too’.”\\n\\nThe proliferation of protests is no guarantee that things will change. “Staging [demonstrations] is no longer the difficult part,” says Youssef Cherif, a political analyst and one of the authors of new Carnegie Endowment research on the success of protest movements. “The problem is what to do after the protests, how to make your point and achieve the goals you’re protesting for. That proves to be the most difficult part.”\\n\\nProtests and revolutions are defined by idealised slogans, he says, but systematic change is harder work. “You can break off part of a system, but it’s very hard to break the whole structure, which is formed of institutions and networks that are difficult to break.”\\n\\nThe leaderless nature of many of the protests makes them harder for authoritarian governments to quash, but it may also make the movements more difficult to sustain, says Sanjoy Chakravorty, a professor of global studies at Temple University. “The movements that actually led to change or that were more sustained, they had a basis, a leadership structure, people articulating, organisation, going door-to-door to get people to show up to a rally,” he says. “The leadership question is central and that is the thing we haven’t figured out yet: how do we actually find leadership in these inchoate displays of anger?”\\n\\nHong Kong Facebook Twitter Pinterest An anti-government protester holds a teargas canister during a protest in Hong Kong. Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters\\n\\nLily Kuo\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\n\\nThe core of the protesters are young people, many of them university or secondary school students. But people from across society, from various sectors and age groups, have also joined the rallies and marches.\\n\\nWhat are they protesting about?\\n\\nOriginally, a proposed change to an extradition law that would allow suspects to be transferred to mainland China and tried in courts controlled by the Communist party. That bill has been withdrawn and now protesters are demonstrating against alleged police brutality and against the government for its handling of the crisis. More broadly, they also oppose growing Chinese influence over the city.\\n\\nHow are authorities reacting?\\n\\nMore than 2,000 people have been arrested, and police are deploying harsher measures to put down demonstrations, including teargas, water cannons that drench people in blue dye laced with pepper solution, and in some cases live rounds. Applications from civil society groups to hold rallies are increasingly being rejected. Colonial-era emergency regulations to ban people from wearing face masks at protests have been invoked.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nFive months in, the number of people taking part in the protests has waned. Still, the unrest shows few signs of ending soon as hardcore demonstrators vow to keep going until all their demands are met.\\n\\nLebanon Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters waving national flags at al-Nour Square in Lebanon’s northern city of Tripoli. Photograph: Ibrahim Chalhoub/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nMichael Safi\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\n\\nA cross-section of society appears to be represented, spanning the religious and political divides that sparked 15 years of civil war in Lebanon starting in 1975. Around 1.3 million people, or 20% of the population, are thought to have attended the largest demonstrations so far, last Sunday.\\n\\nWhat are they protesting about?\\n\\nThe government, an unsteady coalition, is divided and dysfunctional, unwilling or unable to invest in the country’s crumbling roads, upgrade its electricity grid (power cuts are still a daily problem), overhaul the waste collection system or address bulging youth unemployment, among a litany of other issues.\\n\\nOne of the triggers for the latest protests was a 20-cent tax on WhatsApp calls that the government announced as part of a suite of austerity policies to bring the country’s extremely high public debt burden under control.\\n\\nHow are authorities reacting?\\n\\nBecause the ruling cabinet is drawn from a finely balanced collection of sectarian political parties, it is impossible for the government to speak with one voice about the protests. Generally speaking, political leaders across the spectrum have tried to sympathise with the protesters but defended the system and called for the restoration of order. Last week the cabinet agreed to a package of reforms including halving lawmakers’ salaries.\\n\\nThere have reportedly been some attempts by gunmen to intimidate protesters, and the army has used teargas against demonstrators, but the non-violent movement has generally been allowed to flourish, even as it has blocked roads and turned parts of cities into open-air dance parties.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThere is excitement at the prospect of a new, united Lebanese identity being forged in the streets, but also concern that the country’s deep political and religious divisions (and the system built on those divisions) could be reasserted, possibly through some act of sectarian violence. The protest movement is leaderless and has no clear agenda, so even if it were able to dismiss the government, it is unclear what would emerge in its place.\\n\\nChile Facebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators clash with riot police in Santiago, Chile. Photograph: Claudio Reyes/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nTom Phillips\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\n\\nThe protests began in Santiago as a youth-led mutiny, and students remain at the movement’s heart. But as the rebellion has swelled to towns and cities outside the capital, citizens of all ages and social classes have joined in. Many protests have been peaceful but there have been outbreaks of looting and arson attacks on supermarkets, underground stations, government buildings and the headquarters of one conservative newspaper.\\n\\nWhat are they protesting about?\\n\\nThe demonstrations were initially a response to a rise in metro ticket prices. In mid-October, high school students poured on to Santiago’s metro system as part of a fare-dodging campaign designed to force the government to scrap the increase. The protests have since mutated into a far broader battle against inequality, deficient public services, poor wages and pensions and government repression.\\n\\nHow are authorities reacting?\\n\\nThe reaction of the centre-right president, Sebastián Piñera, was at first uncompromising. On Friday last week he declared a state of emergency and ordered thousands of troops on to the streets of Santiago. On Sunday Piñera declared Chile was “at war” with gangs of “evil” delinquents bent on causing destruction. More than 2,600 arrests have been made and at least 15 people have died, four reportedly at the hands of security forces.\\n\\nCritics say the hardline stance has only inflamed the situation. On Tuesday, apparently grasping that, Piñera adopted a softer tone, meeting opposition leaders and making a televised address in which he unveiled a series of new social policies including a slight raise in the minimum wage. He apologised for the “shortsightedness” of Chile’s political leaders.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nIt is unclear whether Piñera’s attempt to de-escalate the situation will work, although with Chile set to host world leaders including Donald Trump and Xi Jinping next month for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, he will be hoping it does. One of the main rallying cries of the movement is that the protests are only just beginning. “Chile despertó,” demonstrators have chanted this week. Chile has awoken.\\n\\nCatalonia Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fires burn after an evening of rioting in Barcelona, Spain. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\\n\\nSam Jones\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\n\\nMost of the protesters who have gathered on the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan towns and cities are young, mainly in their teens and 20s. However, other demonstrations – including the peaceful protest in which an estimated 525,000 people gathered in Barcelona on Friday 18 October – have drawn people of all ages, from children to pensioners.\\n\\nWhat are they protesting about?\\n\\nTensions in the region soared after Spain’s supreme court this month found nine Catalan separatists leaders guilty of sedition and misuse of public funds over their roles in a failed push for independence two years ago. They were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison.\\n\\nAlthough the Catalan independence movement has always prided itself on peaceful protests, there have been numerous violent clashes, with police officers attacked with stones, bottles, molotov cocktails and slingshots, and protesters beaten and shot with rubber and foam bullets.\\n\\nHow are authorities reacting?\\n\\nAround 600 people have received medical treatment and two of them – a police officer and a demonstrator – remain in a critical condition. More than 200 people have been arrested.\\n\\nThe government in Madrid has said its priority is maintaining public order, and it has described its response so far as proportional. It has said cooperation between officers from the national police force and their Catalan counterparts has been very effective and it has rejected calls from rightwing parties to assume direct control of the Catalan police or use the constitution to implement direct rule. The police response has been fiercely criticised by some for allegedly indiscriminately targeting innocent bystanders and members of the media.\\n\\nCatalonia’s pro-independence regional president, Quim Torra, has also been criticised for taking too long to condemn the violence, and for calling for civil disobedience and then sending in the regional police to deal with it.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThings have calmed down significantly since the height of the protests at the end of last week. Torra has called for talks with the Spanish government but has also threatened to protest against the supreme court verdict by staging another unilateral referendum on Catalan independence. The Spanish government, led by acting the acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has dismissed the calls, accusing Torra’s administration of failing to do enough to guarantee public order and of ignoring the will of the majority of Catalans who oppose independence. Even if the protests fade, the Catalan question will remain a key issue in Spain’s general election next month.\\n\\nIraq Facebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters in Baghdad, Iraq. Photograph: Khalid al-Mousily/Reuters\\n\\nMichael Safi\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\n\\nThis month’s protests in Iraq were leaderless but mostly driven by young and unemploymed people in a country with a stubbornly high jobless rate and where nearly a quarter of the population live in poverty.\\n\\nWhat are they protesting about?\\n\\nAfter decades of sanctions, a US-led invasion and years of civil war, including against Islamic State, Iraq’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair, its public services are inadequate and it is struggling to rebuild its economy. Corruption is endemic, a problem that the country’s sectarian political parties have little appetite to try to change. Iraq’s protests are a howl of anger against the system.\\n\\nOne immediate trigger is also thought to be the demotion of Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi, an army officer who became prominent during the fight against Isis and was regarded as a rare hero across sectarian lines. The reason he lost his position has not been publicly explained, but many Iraqis suspect it is because he tried to fight corruption in the country’s counter-terrorism service.\\n\\nHow are authorities reacting?\\n\\nAlmost 150 people were killed over the five most intense days of the protests this month, which the UN described as “senseless loss of life”. About 70% died from bullet wounds to the head or chest, according to the findings of a government inquiry this week. The committee concluded that officers and commanders “lost control over their forces during the protests” and that this “caused chaos”. It found evidence that some protesters were killed by a sniper operating from an abandoned building in Baghdad. The report called for dozens of senior security officials to be dismissed and referred to prosecutors for possible trial.\\n\\nWhat next?\\n\\nThere were calls for fresh demonstrations starting on Friday, the one-year anniversary of Iraq’s prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, taking office. Abdul-Mahdi has promised reforms and to reshuffle his cabinet to try to satisfy protesters.', 'Back in July 2015, the senior coroner Louise Hunt concluded that a “catalogue of very serious mistakes” had been made by many people involved in the planning and execution of an SAS test march in which three candidates had suffered fatal heat illness on a hot summer day.\\n\\nOutside court, the Ministry of Defence claimed it had already made changes following the tragedy in the Brecon Beacons, south Wales, in 2013 and would do everything it could to prevent such a disaster happening again.\\n\\nBut on 19 July 2016 – almost exactly a year after the coroner’s highly critical remarks – there was yet another death in the same area on a similar searingly hot day.\\n\\nCarrying 25kg (55lb) of equipment, Cpl Joshua Hoole, 26, collapsed 400 metres from the end of an eight-mile course in the Brecon Beacons as the temperature built towards the 30C mark.\\n\\nDuring Hoole’s four-week inquest before the same coroner in Birmingham this October, many of the issues that were pored over during the SAS hearing came to the forefront again. How was the exercise planned? Should it have been stopped when soldiers began to fall? Did the army really understand the danger heat poses during training even in southern Britain? Had lessons really been learned since the SAS deaths?\\n\\nArmy did not learn from previous SAS test tragedies, inquest hears Read more\\n\\nHoole was a talented and popular member of 1 Rifles from southern Scotland who joined the army in 2008, served in Afghanistan and had a bright future ahead of him. “He shone his light on all of us,” said his father, Phillip Hoole, himself a former army sergeant major. “Had his life not been extinguished, I am sure that he would have achieved much more.”\\n\\nAt first, it seemed that hot weather was not to blame. A defence service inquiry concluded Hoole had died not because of the heat but an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, sudden arrhythmic death syndrome.\\n\\nBut Hoole’s father came to doubt that conclusion and, believing there to be organisational failings in the way the exercise was handled, successfully applied for a full and detailed inquest to take place.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phillip Hoole, Cpl Joshua Hoole’s father. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\\n\\nDuring the inquest it has emerged that of the 41 corporals and lance corporals taking part in the annual fitness test (AFT) that day, only 24 completed the course. The average drop-out on the same route for the whole of the previous year was 3%.\\n\\nVivid accounts were given of how some of those who took part in the AFT came to fall.\\n\\nCpl Anasa Matau described being hit by “heat and exhaustion”. He said: “My core body was hot, I had salty deposits around my mouth and hands, and I told myself I thought I was dehydrated.” He was so confused that he tried to get his combat shirt off without removing his day-sack. He was taken to hospital and was told he would have died if he hadn’t stopped, the inquest heard.\\n\\nThe AFT in which Hoole died had been due to begin at 11am but started at 7am because hot weather was forecast. The inquest heard that it was believed the temperature at this time was above 20C – the mark at which such exercises should not take place.\\n\\nProf George Havenith, a heat stress and heat strain expert from Loughborough University, was asked on a balance of probabilities whether the march should have gone ahead. Havenith said it should not. Asked if Hoole would be alive if the exercise had not been run or had been stopped half an hour before he collapsed, Havenith replied: “Yes.”\\n\\nHavenith’s testimony echoed some of what he said during the SAS inquest. He argued then that inadequate planning for the treatment of casualties had contributed to the deaths in 2013 of Cpl James Dunsby, L/Cpl Craig Roberts and L/Cpl Edward Maher and said they would have survived if they had been stopped at the last checkpoint they had passed through.\\n\\nAs during the SAS inquest there was much focus on a piece of kit called the wet bulb globe thermometer or WBGT, which takes factors such as heat, humidity and wind into account when producing a reading.\\n\\nHavenith told the inquest the readings from the WBGT could not have been relied on by those in charge of the exercise because it was positioned in the shade of a gym building.\\n\\nThe fitness instructors who were in charge of the WBGT on the day of Hoole’s death said they had not received any training on how to use the device for at least 10 years.\\n\\nDespite the MoD’s promises to learn lessons following the SAS tragedy, worrying signs emerged that there may still be problems over the running of exercises on hot days.\\n\\nA captain who signed off a risk assessment for the AFT said he had read a crucial document called JSP 539 – which relates to climatic illness and was featured repeatedly during the SAS inquest – but was not trained to interpret it.\\n\\nThe MoD has been keen to play down any link between the deaths of the SAS candidates and Hoole. The army cardiologist Maj Andrew Cox told the inquest he did not believe heat should be recorded as a factor in Hoole’s official cause of death. He suggested “exertion” could have been a contributing factor but said: “I believe this was a sudden arrhythmic death syndrome death.”\\n\\nHoole’s father, who had helped run similar exercises during his career, agreed that a number of factors could be at play but told the major starkly during the inquest: “I used to call it cooking yourself from the inside out.”', 'Film fans have made major destinations of all sorts of unlikely places, from Hugh Grant’s door in Notting Hill to the delicatessen in which Sally faked a very enthusiastic orgasm\\n\\nResidents of the Bronx are furious that a once anonymous flight of stairs between Shakespeare Avenue and Anderson Avenue has become the hottest tourist attraction in the world.

Some recognised the actor, others just clapped and cheered anyway.\\n\\nBell, now 35, has spent the past 10 years as a secret weapon, briefly unleashed, in a series of big Hollywood comedies (and a couple of Paul Thomas Anderson pictures). She was a withering bridal shower guest in Bridesmaids, an unlikely pimp in Office Christmas Party and, most memorably, a stunningly insulting and deadpan foil to Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street. That film was a showcase for Bell’s particular gift: extra-dry delivery of wildly strange dialogue, much of it improvised.\\n\\n“Jillian makes me want to quit show business and realise I am a complete fraud,” said Hill during the press tour, “because she is the funniest person I have ever met in my life.”\\n\\nJump Street took $330m (£256m); prospects are rather more modest for her first film as a lead, Brittany Runs a Marathon, about which critical buzz has gathered pace since its debut at Sundance earlier this year. Loosely based on a friend of the film’s writer-director, Paul Downs Colaizzo, Brittany is a New Yorker in her late 20s, mired in toxic relationships and self-destruction. Attempting to score some prescription drugs from a doctor, she is informed that she is dangerously overweight and urgently needs to lose 40lb (18kg). Brittany pulls on her trainers, steps away from social media and changes her life. “She was flawed, and joyful,” says Bell. “In pain and then hilarious the next moment.” She is, she says, unlike anyone she has played before.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell as Brittany.\\n\\nThe film carefully negotiates its way around fat-shaming territory, not subscribing to the idea that life becomes perfect once you achieve your target weight. “Brittany realises it was never about losing weight, it was about growing up and taking ownership for yourself,” says Bell, who lost about 18kg before and during the shoot; she wore padding for the marathon scenes (she didn’t run the whole thing, in fact) because the film-makers were concerned she looked too slim. “But we were not going to shy away from how society treats you if you lose weight, and how that can sometimes seep into your own values.”\\n\\nIn one scene – which Bell says is the hardest thing she has ever shot – Brittany is unspeakably cruel to a woman larger than herself. She spoke beforehand to the actor playing the woman, “because I’ve auditioned for – or played – a role like hers before and it doesn’t feel fun.” Does it seem important to play women who aren’t always – dread word – likable?\\n\\nI know a lot of women who look like me. They have love in their lives and love for themselves. Where are those roles?\\n\\nShe smiles, likably. “I think it’s important to play women as real human beings. A lot of times the word ‘likable’ comes up, especially as a writer. They want to make sure that all the women are very likable and I think that’s unfair because we’ve had a lot of male characters who are incredibly unlikable that we root for. I’m hoping women start to do that more: play characters who are flawed and make mistakes.”\\n\\nSince the 28-day shoot, Bell has regained about half the weight she lost and feels, she says, “more like myself”. She is overweight only by Hollywood standards. To anyone else, she looks, sitting in a black jumpsuit on a sofa, a plate of biscuits between us, completely normal – albeit wildly pretty.\\n\\nYet Bell has struggled with her body image. She wasn’t sure if making the film would help, or exacerbate the problem. “There’s only so much you can shake off the character. You have to figure out what your own story is. And [after making the film] I feel I’m in a much better place. It’s still rocky at times, but I try to be as kind to myself as I can.” Brittany Runs a Marathon, she says, made her realise how much she beat herself up. “What would it be like if I really enjoyed the things I was doing and focused less on how I looked? To look at all the seeds that have been planted in my brain from a very young age of what women should look like, and re-examine those thoughts and see if they’re feeding me or not? And most of them were not feeding me.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell as Brittany.\\n\\nStill, it must take some deep inner confidence to believe – be, as she says, “weirdly of the opinion” – that she wouldn’t change herself to better fit into the film industry. “Not like Hollywood would change for me, but I just thought if I get an opportunity to show what I can do, hopefully it will be enough. I know that it’s probably a lot easier if you’re going the route of comedy over drama.” She has “heard some horror stories”, but never been advised to lose weight to get work, although she also says there have been numerous casting calls for roles for curvier women “that didn’t feel they were worthy of love. I was like: ‘I know a lot of women who look like me and they have love in their lives and love for themselves. Where are those roles?’”\\n\\nBell grew up in Las Vegas, where her father worked in advertising for many of the casinos. “Little things were odd,” she says, “like slot machines at the grocery store.” She always wanted to perform, going to improvisation classes when she was eight and starting an improv group at high school; her dream, from childhood, was to be on Saturday Night Live.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bell in 22 Jump Street.\\n\\nAs a teenager, she began to have panic attacks, which continue to this day – she had one flying to London. She is eager to be open about anxiety: “I would have liked to know when I was younger who was also going through this and that I wouldn’t feel as alone.” She once had an attack in the middle of filming, she says: “I got through it, but it was really hard. I thought I was going to quit, but, thank goodness, I had another job I had already committed to. The people there were very warm, and I was very open about what happened.”\\n\\nBell moved to LA when she was 18, and worked at a talent agency before landing small roles in the likes of Curb Your Enthusiasm (in the episode The Bare Midriff, as Larry David’s distractingly unclad assistant), and as part of the Groundlings comedy theatre. At 25, she tried out for Saturday Night Live: she failed as a performer, but was signed on as a writer – although only for a year. “I was disappointed not to have performed on it. But I’m a really big believer in the whole ‘everything happens for a reason’ thing. A few years after that my dad passed away and I wouldn’t have been around to spend time with him, I wouldn’t have got the dog I have in my life now, [if I had been] stuck in New York for a long period of time.”\\n\\nPlus, she then shot the telemarketers sitcom Workaholics, whose fans included Paul Thomas Anderson, who cast her in The Master (as a woman in Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s group therapy scene) and in Inherent Vice (as a weird waitress to Benicio del Toro and Joaquin Phoenix).\\n\\nBell has written a film she hopes will start shooting next year, and runs a production company with her sister (with whom she lives). She is also in the next Bill & Ted instalment, and a gender-swapping remake of Splash, in which she will play opposite her Jump Street co-star Channing Tatum in the mermaid role.\\n\\nWhy does she think reboots of those old films are so popular? “I think it’s a simpler time. It feels very chaotic in the world right now, especially back in America and I think people miss the times of not having cellphones and just experiencing the world. A lot of the films in the 80s and 90s really explored relationships, and whimsical things, and things just felt lighter.” People need to laugh, she says, “more than ever. And people need to feel hope. I think with our movie too, there’s a lot of hope in there, and hopefully it’s inspiring to people.” The biscuits on the table remain untouched, and the next day I put on my running shoes.\\n\\n• Brittany Runs a Marathon is released in the UK on 1 November', 'It started during the 1999 eclipse. The year before, I had run away to Devon. Lots of bad things had happened there, but the main one was that I’d got fat. On my 27th birthday, I was 5ft 6in and weighed a hefty (as I bizarrely thought then) 9st 2lb. Worse: according to every news story I read, I was going to get an incurable disease and die. The most likely cause would be food; mad cow disease hadn’t gone away, and then there were pesticides and insecticides and growth hormones. When a friend told me he’d heard organic diets were cancer-preventing, I was in. As the skies darkened on 11 August, and birds began their evening song hours too early, I pledged that if I survived the solar eclipse, I would eat only organic food. I would stay healthy, and I would not die.\\n\\nWhen organic food didn’t make my life perfect, I tried food combining (no protein with carbs). Then veganism. For 20 years now, I have cycled between diets and diet books, in search of the perfect hack for a good life: great health, better skin, the optimum weight and all, of course, with minimal impact on the environment. (Like so many women who dedicate their eating disorders to saving the planet, I need what I eat to be in some way an ethical choice.) I have been a vegetarian, a meat eater; I have gone paleo, keto, macrobiotic, pegan (look it up).\\n\\nNow I am in my 40s, I have more than 100 different food rules that I have collected from various places. They range from the obvious (white wheat isn’t that healthy) to the ridiculous (tomatoes are very “yin”). Food rules are not hard to find. You can follow hashtags on Instagram such as #cleaneating (45.5m posts) or #vegan (85.3m) or #absaremadeinthekitchen (1.6m). There are thousands of YouTube What I Eat In A Day videos posted by famous models and influencers. A bit of Googling can put you in touch with Victoria’s Secret diets, ballerina diets, even diets to improve your mental health. You can learn why veganism is good for your heart, and why keto helps with anxiety and autism. The big question, though: which one to choose?\\n\\nI am a novelist, but diet books are my embarrassing comfort read. I read them when I am bored, stressed, on a late train, facing a deadline. Recently I realised that I use them like porn, reading my favourites over and over again. As with porn, I quickly discovered a “type” of narrative that works best. Perhaps my ur-diet book is Robb Wolf’s The Paleo Solution, which begins with the author’s mysteriously sick parents, then describes how his own long period of vegetarianism left him almost dead at the age of 28, mainly as a consequence of his undiagnosed coeliac disease. Wolf began his new life with meat and a salad, and never looked back: “I was warmly satisfied, clear headed and I felt better than I had in years. After one meal.” I have read this passage over and over again, particularly when I am having a vegan crisis and need an excuse to try something else.\\n\\n“Is it weird that I love diet books?” I sometimes ask people, experimentally. But no one else seems to have my problem, even though everyone is now an expert on diet. While most people take it all with a pinch of salt (not so bad for your blood pressure, it turns out), I take it all very, very seriously. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to eat without a precise set of instructions. One major joy of my diet books is feeling that I belong, that I am part of a belief system, a member of a team. But the downside is, this stuff can send you nuts (which have more carbs than you’d think, but are a good source of selenium and fibre).\\n\\nMost of the time, this obsession is fine. And then there are the dark times when I suddenly have to hard-delete every paleo book from my Kindle, only to buy them all again the next day. Or when I go through my Ocado favourites and remove anything not strictly vegan and spend hours creating the “perfect” clean order, only to then cancel the whole thing in the nick of time, just before it leaves the warehouse.\\n\\nAfter one bowl of pasta and a dessert, I had a terrible panic attack. For hours I lay in bed hardly able to breathe\\n\\nWhen I am busy with my writing, happy and distracted by life, I can stay on a mild version of one of my regimes for a few months. But when stressed, I start cycling through the possibilities like an anxious lab rat trying every door to find the one that leads out. I still want so badly to get it right. I want people to stop me in the street and say, “But you look amazing! And you seem so very, very healthy. What’s your secret?” I know a lot about every single possible answer. But at my worst moments, I have forced myself to believe in completely different paradigms, sometimes all in one day. Not so much believing six impossible things before breakfast as believing six impossible things about breakfast. Could I be a spiritual person while eating meat? Is our time on Earth supposed to be about kindness and the veneration of life, or is it better to accept the natural cycle: that we eat animals and are then returned into the earth to feed them? Was everything I ate in some way wrong?\\n\\nAs a fiction writer, it’s my job to wonder about, and dramatise, such things. But that drama has filtered through my life. During a pegan episode, I ended up hungry at a pasta restaurant with a limited menu. After one bowl of pasta and a dessert (well, why not?), I had a terrible panic attack. For countless hours I lay in bed sweating and hardly able to breathe, believing that gluten was attacking my insides, that I would develop an autoimmune disease, schizophrenia and lupus. At other times, I ate meat and fixated on the rotting corpse in my stomach, desperately wanting it out.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe term “orthorexia” was coined in 1997 by Dr Steven Bratman, author of the leading book on the subject, Health Food Junkies. I don’t have that book any longer: I Marie Kondo-ed it after it calmly told me that it was possible to die from orthorexia. This did not bring me joy. But it also confirmed that I had been suffering from it for several years. Despite increasing awareness, orthorexia is not listed in the International Classification of Diseases, or in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, it has made its way into the Oxford English Dictionary, and is increasingly ingrained in our culture.\\n\\nOrthorexia is an obsession with “pure” or “healthy” food. It is treated as a type of anorexia because sufferers typically reduce their food intake over a period of time, often becoming raw-foodists, “juicearians” or even “sproutarians”. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Sufferers may appear to friends as simply “a bit fussy” or, like me, as “health-conscious”. And suffering inside doesn’t always show. A friend recently asked me if I (like her) felt like an impostor because I don’t look like someone who has an eating disorder. I knew what she meant. The standard eating disorder recovery “look” on Instagram is willowy and tragic, and I am a size 12-14.\\n\\nIn many ways, I don’t even stand out among the people I know. I have two close friends who struggle with irritable bowel syndrome. In the last two years, one went to a kinesiologist (they are the ones who make you hold a food item; if you feel weak, you are allergic to it), while the other had parasitic hookworms injected into her arm. Another close friend is low-carbing to combat her polycystic ovary syndrome, and another is on keto for his arthritis. We have all become persuaded we can self-medicate through food, and maybe this is even true. My friends are all neurotic, but they glow with health.\\n\\nWhenever I sit down for dinner with my editor, we compare regimes. “Land animals,” he said last time, explaining what was taboo for him at that moment. “And dairy.” Another friend moves between low-GI, low-carb and fasting. We have both been doing 16:8, where you fast for 16 hours of every 24, for ages. We send each other pictures of sticks we have peed on to see if we are in ketosis, the point at which the body starts breaking fat down. Another friend is on the warrior diet, which involves eating one big meal a day. We all have proper jobs in health, publishing or the arts.\\n\\nWhen I tell people I am recovering from an eating disorder called orthorexia, they usually mishear it as “authorexia”, and perhaps, for me, that’s what it is: an eating disorder based around storytelling. An eating disorder for authors, or at least encouraged by them. One macrobiotic writer suggests listening to Shakespeare if you have heart trouble, because the iambic pentameter will stabilise you. When it comes to the diet books, the different regimes, it is always the stories that do it: the familiar, comforting narrative arc of the lost soul who discovers the secret that leads to health, purity and beauty. The brave, bold young American who finds the truth that eluded his parents. The fat-adapted ultramarathon runners who do it all on a spoonful of coconut oil.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAfter my 1999 solar eclipse weight crisis, I bought two books about food combining in a Dartmouth bookshop. Before that, I’d rarely seen a diet book. When I was growing up, our house was full of books, but not that kind. After all, wasn’t dieting one of those twee things oppressed women did in the 50s because the patriarchy said they should?\\n\\nThe food-combining books didn’t just tell me not to eat protein and carbs together, advice I have tried to follow ever since (I still feel guilty when I fail). They told me what would happen if I did: along with indigestion and arthritis, I might get candida, anxiety, depression, IBS and chronic fatigue. One chapter was titled How Toxic Are You? The symptoms included being bored, tired, having aches and pains, few ideas and poor concentration. This was me! (And, of course, every writer I knew.) How lucky I’d found these books before I died of literally everything. But there were the success stories, too, and these became what I craved. Stories of people being brought back from the brink, people who had almost died and then been cured by avocado cream.\\n\\nI bought more books, which could be unintentionally funny, too. One favourite talked knowledgably about the behaviour of animals in the wild. “When that lion ate the zebra, it wasn’t having a baked potato with it,” it pointed out. But, of course, I was not a lion. I was following all the instructions, but not losing any weight. In fact, I was putting weight on.\\n\\nIf I was not a lion, I wondered, what was I? A caveperson, came back the answer. A human with a genetic code that has not fundamentally changed for 10,000 years and whose system simply cannot compute “Haribo” or “bagel”. At first I ruled out “ancestral” diets because of all the meat, but Rose Elliot’s vegetarian low-carb book became the gateway that culminated a couple of years later in Wolf’s Paleo Solution. There were heady days of fried halloumi and eggs and mushrooms in butter, bowls of berries and cream. I loved the food, and most of my How Toxic Are You? symptoms went. I stopped feeling nervous all the time. But I didn’t lose any weight, so I went vegan again.\\n\\nFor the next few years I swung between extremes so frequently that from a distance I might have appeared moderate. My weight increased until it hit 11st (70kg), and then refused to budge. On the outside I looked like a M-L person, a Topshop size 14, able to fit into 30in-waist jeans from anywhere but All Saints. Inside, I was suffering all the time. Pictures taken at literary festivals showed me with a double chin and flabby arms, looming over a lectern like Jabba the Hutt. Me! In my head I still looked like Kate Moss in the 90s.\\n\\nI started looking for clues about what other women ate: the ones who still have flat stomachs in their 40s, who still look like pictures in magazines and who don’t seem to use three filters at once on Instagram (like I do). I am ashamed to say that when I spotted Arundhati Roy looking glowing in a hotel restaurant at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, I watched to see what she ate, and was disappointed by a cappuccino. (But was it soya, almond or cow’s milk?) Enabled by a world that is still fixated on women’s bodies, on slow days I would do online research to determine which of my regimes actually worked on other people. The fact that they’d failed to work on me was my fault, not the fault of the diet, of course.\\n\\nIt is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness\\n\\nHad they failed? Perhaps I sound mentally unstable, but physically I am as strong as an ox. Whenever I am ill – which, perhaps due to all the kale and vitamins, is very rarely – I think back to the last thing I ate and blame it on that. But could it be that these “healthy” diets actually work? Maybe I am meant to be a size 12-14 person who gets one (if that) cold a year. Of course I am constantly on guard against any sort of illness, ready at all times with my turmeric and green tea and manuka honey. And I don’t want to admit I feel healthy in case I tempt fate and am diagnosed with an incurable disease.\\n\\nI’d love to say that all this is in the past, but it is unlikely I will ever be able to get out of my head all the stories I believe about food and illness. In that sense, I’ll be authorexic for ever, even if at times I have got my orthorexia more or less under control. I spend most of my time now on a lowish carb diet simply because it makes me feel better mentally and comes with less plastic packaging, and I’ve almost, but not quite, come to terms with my size and shape. But I can still be easily triggered: a column on being vegan for the environment can turn me for a week or two; coverage of the health benefits of Tom Watson’s keto diet will exert an influence. If I had seen Roy’s breakfast, I would have adopted it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my Instagram heaves with body positivity. I love Lizzo and Ashley Graham, and all the many muscly heroines of CrossFit. But they are young and beautiful, and I am 47. They are naturally glorious, while I still need help. I just don’t have that jawline – though a part of me thinks that there is a diet to fix that. One of my favourite new books is about intuitive eating, where you eat what you want (yes, including Big Macs and Twirls) on the basis that your body will eventually ask only for what it needs. As one of my friends despairingly asked, “How is that even possible?”\\n\\nLast week I was in the supermarket trying to decide between organic brazil nuts and nonorganic pistachio nuts (this is close to my natural state) when I became aware of two teenage girls in the same aisle. They were browsing the “Free From” foods. They looked perfectly healthy and robust: everything you should be at 15. They were surrounded, as I was, by abundance: cheap, plentiful food. “Let’s get some gluten-free stuff,” one said to the other. “Apparently it helps you lose weight.” I wanted to interrupt, to say something to them, but what? That it’s not true, and all that gluten-free stuff is just full of sugar? That they really don’t need to lose any weight?

Most people were wrong about a lot of things.\\n\\nNearly four years later, the US political world revolves around the tweets of an erratic Fox News-watching grandpa who just so happens to run the most powerful country on Earth. Like any avid TV viewer, Trump has his favorite stories, and few rival the morning show Fox & Friends, where he spent years making frequent appearances before diving into politics.\\n\\nSince July 2018, I’ve been one among a lucky few live-tweeting the show along with the president. And after consuming thousands of hours of Rupert Murdoch’s finest drivel, I’ve learned a few things about how America’s No 1 news network is dragging the United States into ruin.\\n\\nAt Fox News, opinion is king – not news\\n\\nFox & Friends’ main hosts – Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade – are a consistent train wreck of shameless hackery, even managing to turn a report about Trump’s $1bn in business losses into a glowing endorsement of his bold, wealthy brilliance.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Ainsley Earhardt on the NY Times story about Trump\\'s $1 billion+ in business losses: \"If anything, you read this and you\\'re like \\'wow, it\\'s pretty impressive, all the things that he\\'s done in his life.\\' It\\'s beyond what most of us could ever achieve.\" pic.twitter.com/H4QQOWJewm\\n\\nOfficially, Fox & Friends is an opinion show, but the ostensibly separate news side – which also lies daily – pops up a lot.\\n\\nEd Henry’s role in the news division is chief national correspondent, but in the opinion division he’s a co-host of the weekend edition of Fox & Friends and occasional guest host of the main weekday show – on which he once led a segment asking whether climate change and “extreme weather” were the same thing (they are not).\\n\\n\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Fox\\'s Ed Henry: \"We know it\\'s cold outside. Now the left is actually using new terms for global warming, like \\'extreme weather.\\' Why do they keep changing the language? Are they just pushing the same old agenda with new words?\" pic.twitter.com/hRL1M5Oooo\\n\\nRecently, the chief national correspondent reported that the CIA whistleblower had a political bias against Trump; Henry reported this not on one of Fox’s “news” shows, but with the pro-Trump propagandist Sean Hannity.\\n\\nLater, while guest-hosting Fox & Friends, Henry discussed how “important” it was that his reporting on Hannity was helping Trump distract people from the impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Ed Henry takes credit for first breaking the whistleblower bias story \"a few weeks ago on Sean Hannity\\'s program,\" and connects it to Trump going \"on offense ... and that\\'s important, because it\\'s turning the focus a bit away from what happened on the call.\" pic.twitter.com/mREUczYN7H\\n\\nHenry’s fellow correspondent Griff Jenkins also sometimes co-hosts Fox & Friends, where he gets to divulge exclusive reporting like his allegation that ethnic studies classes aren’t educational. Rather, he said, “they’re making social justice warriors out of children” – a blood-red culture-warrior attack absurd enough to prompt a chuckle from the guest.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Fox & Friends host/news reporter Griff Jenkins claims that ethnic studies courses aren\\'t \"teaching studies, they\\'re making social justice warriors out of children.\" https://t.co/FQdjSiKMIG pic.twitter.com/nL1rp33b5s\\n\\nJenkins often does field reporting on immigration for Fox & Friends, a lowlight of which involved him literally hiding in the bushes along the US-Mexico border to help border patrol detain a migrant family.\\n\\nAfter they were caught, a seemingly celebratory chyron read “Illegal admits to knowingly breaking the law”. Jenkins closed his report by discussing a wanted murderer and a known gang member who were caught trying to cross the border. Neither had anything to do with the family he helped arrest.\\n\\n\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Fox\\'s Griff Jenkins got to play Border Patrol yesterday, foiling and shaming a family\\'s attempt to escape rampant extortion in Honduras. pic.twitter.com/QWAuOhcRWc\\n\\nFox & Friends’ combination of sloppy news coverage and fierce rightwing opinion is a microcosm of how much Fox values each side of the network.\\n\\nTake, for example, the legitimate journalist and former chief news anchor Shepard Smith: after he had a dramatic on-air feud with the opinion kingpin Tucker Carlson, both Fox News’ CEO and its president reportedly threatened to take Smith off the air if he criticized Carlson again.\\n\\nA few weeks later, Smith resigned from the network he had renewed his contract with last year. The sudden end of his 23-year Fox career shows what happens at that network when news and opinion irreconcilably collide. But on Fox & Friends, as with most of the rest of Fox, the “news” knows its place.\\n\\nFox News editorially taints other news media outlets\\n\\nOne of the ways Fox News corrodes politics is by influencing the larger conversation; in fact, you may be essentially consuming Fox propaganda without knowing it.\\n\\nAnd as the network’s flagship morning show for over 20 years, Fox & Friends often sets the tone for how the network as a whole discusses any given issue. This line from the pastor and Fox contributor Robert Jeffress sums up a lot of Fox’s abortion coverage:\\n\\n\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Pastor and Fox News contributor Robert Jeffress: \"The Democrats believe the great human right that transcends all others is the right to kill your own babies through abortion.\" Ainsley Earhardt responds by telling Jeffress he is \"so important to our country. ... We love you.\" pic.twitter.com/2GBeRGuBLW\\n\\nJeffress’s unhinged comment highlighted a debate you may have heard of about so-called “post-birth” abortion, a procedure disproved by its very name. If the abortion happens after a child is born, then it’s not abortion; it’s murder, which is already very illegal everywhere.\\n\\nYet, as Vox’s Anna North recounted, the idea that there’s such a thing as “post-birth” abortion – and that there are people who want it to be – became such a potent meme that the president spoke against it and congressional Republicans made more than 70 attempts to protect abortion “survivors” with legislation.\\n\\n\\'Fox News brain\\': meet the families torn apart by toxic cable news Read more\\n\\nThis abject nonsense spiraled into a mainstream debate because of modest attempts to loosen restrictions on reproductive rights in New York and Virginia. The efforts spurred numerous attacks, including from Trump, who falsely claimed the governor of Virginia had said he “would execute a baby after birth”, and from Fox & Friends commentators, who rabidly declared that “infanticide” and “fourth trimester” abortion were actual progressive policy goals.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Anti-choice Fox guest shamelessly lies that \"you will not see a doctor at Planned Parenthood unless you are having an abortion,\" and that the group \"advocates for late-term abortion and infanticide.\" pic.twitter.com/BietIDxKi2\\n\\nThis example demonstrates a trend. My colleagues Sharon Kann and Julie Tulbert examined an entire year of evening news abortion coverage on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News and found that Fox aired 94% of all three networks’ statements about abortion, and Fox was wrong 85% of the time.\\n\\nThis means that when CNN and MSNBC discuss abortion, they are often just responding to Fox News misinformation (while still managing to be wrong 67% and 40% of the time, respectively).\\n\\nFox News mainstreams white supremacy\\n\\nFox prime time has rightly earned a reputation as a cable TV haven for white supremacy, but, as with all things Fox News, Fox & Friends also plays a prominent role.\\n\\nIn October 2018, Fox News became a wailing siren on immigration, claiming that the US was under “invasion” by undocumented immigrants – specifically, a group of Central American migrants traveling (mostly walking) over 1,000 miles to the US-Mexico border.\\n\\nIn one week, Fox ran nearly eight hours of content on the then distant caravan. Fox & Friends started nearly every morning with anti-immigrant hysteria, eventually suggesting the US take military action to “protect our sovereignty” from families fleeing gang violence and endemic poverty.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) ‘In Defense of Internment’ author Michelle Malkin: The caravan “is a full-scale invasion by a hostile force. And it requires our president and our commander-in-chief to use any means necessary to protect our sovereignty.” pic.twitter.com/imDJtNe7qF\\n\\nThe very day after that comment aired on Fox & Friends, a white supremacist murdered 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, because he blamed Jews for helping the “invaders” in the caravan.\\n\\nCaravan hysteria eventually passed, but Fox News’ dangerous and false melodrama about an immigrant “invasion” continued.\\n\\nSome months later, yet another mass shooter struck – this time murdering 20 in El Paso, to stop the “Hispanic invasion of Texas”. Kilmeade passionately defended using the dangerously hyperbolic term “invasion” just three days later.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Brian Kilmeade on undocumented immigration: \"If you use the term \\'this is an invasion,\\' that\\'s not anti-Hispanic. It\\'s a fact.\" pic.twitter.com/Gh0Aks7t7s\\n\\nDid Fox News inspire two white supremacist mass shootings? Probably not directly. Is it disturbing that America’s number one news network discusses immigration like bloodthirsty white supremacists? Yes.\\n\\nFox News ‘is about defending our viewers from the people who hate them’\\n\\nA Fox News executive reportedly told Vanity Fair that the network’s “power comes from” its viewers, and it must defend them.\\n\\nThat sentiment neatly encapsulates how and why Fox inspires a strong sense of brand loyalty among its viewers – more so than other cable networks. On a number of issues, from recent (false) allegations of anti-conservative censorship on social media to the tried-and-true (and misleading) trope of “Dems are coming for your guns”, Fox News consistently tells viewers that there are hostile groups that want to revoke their rights, undermine their values, and cause them harm.\\n\\nAnd having identified Trump, reverentially, as “our president”, Fox staff and guests alike say that any attack on Trump means Fox viewers could be next – a mutation of a longstanding culture of conservative victimhood, amplified bigly by the president himself.\\n\\n\\n\\nFox works hard to support these audience relationships, with its efforts spearheaded by its flagship morning show. Fox & Friends regularly airs live episodes with studio audiences, often including law enforcement officers, who receive regular effusive praise on Fox. These episodes provide lucky fans a chance to come to Manhattan, speak their minds, and have their opinions validated by their favorite TV stars.\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Brian Kilmeade agrees with a guest who says \"there\\'s no other way\" to describe undocumented immigration except as an \"invasion\": \"It seems like that. You got a million people coming in here who don\\'t want to sign the guest book.\" pic.twitter.com/8lzhEC5mYA\\n\\nBreakfast with Friends is a frequently recurring segment in which secondary hosts and correspondents travel to diners across the country, usually shadowing a Trump rally or election debate, to get the pulse of the people.\\n\\nStrangely, when devoted Fox fans go on Fox to offer their opinions, they typically echo the conservative, pro-Trump line you can find from Fox mainstays. Breakfast with Friends has a similar goal to the live audience shows: offering Fox fans an opportunity to appear on TV and enjoy validation from their favorite personalities over sometimes-absurd amounts of breakfast food.\\n\\nArlen Parsa (@arlenparsa) Fox News is interviewing a man who is eating ten eggs this morning. https://t.co/Do2548O2Jr\\n\\nFox News is now attempting to expand its footprint in viewers’ minds with the subscription streaming service Fox Nation. Fox Nation offers original documentaries on favorite rightwing media scandals, shares hot takes from opinionistas like Tomi Lahren and Diamond & Silk, and gives some on-air talent a chance to show another side of themselves to the Fox viewer.\\n\\nFor example, Kilmeade has an American history series that calls Andrew “Trail of Tears” Jackson a “hero”; the contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy has a show about motherhood; and Ainsley Earhardt hosts Ainsley’s Bible Study. The aim is to show Fox News superfans what their favorite “Fox News personalities do outside the newsroom”, drawing viewers tighter into the network’s destructive embrace.\\n\\nFox News poisons viewers’ minds\\n\\nPeople who watch Fox News with an open mind can find themselves sucked into a destructive and alienating lifestyle. The writer Luke O’Neil collected several examples of families, his own included, divided by Fox News’ partisan garbage fire. O’Neil and his mother “have agreed to not talk about politics any more. The cognitive dissonance between this lovely woman finding something appealing in the most xenophobic pundits on TV is too hard for me to reconcile.”\\n\\nOthers told him about no longer visiting their home towns “because my family and friends all have broken Fox brain” or about not sending their children to see their grandparents because, thanks to Fox News, “their toxic anger and resentment is slowly becoming their entire identity”.\\n\\nI can tell you from personal experience that when I say Fox poisons minds, I’m not being that hyperbolic. While watching Fox & Friends every morning, I struggle to unearth or at least assemble even shadows of fact-based arguments from the unhinged nonsense that is vital to the brand.\\n\\nIt can be so intense on Fox & Friends that I sometimes have what could be called propaganda hangovers – after finishing the show, I feel as though I’m trapped in a fog of disinformation, and my mental processes feel sluggish for a few more minutes.\\n\\nMy strongest bulwark against succumbing is strident opposition. Once you know you’re watching stupid bullshit, sometimes that stupid bullshit becomes must-see TV:\\n\\n\\n\\nBobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) Steve Doocy patiently tries to explain to Brian Kilmeade that Fox & Friends (which starts at 6 AM) is on between \\'The Five\\' (which starts at 5 PM) and \\'Outnumbered Overtime\\' (which starts at 1 PM). (h/t @grace_sleepy) pic.twitter.com/02wbdPSEBs\\n\\nFox News is ridiculous, stupid, and – when it doesn’t mean to be – hilarious. Most importantly, it’s an extremely influential stream of conservative misinformation. And the president’s favorite show, Fox & Friends, encapsulates the totality of the rotten network’s inherent conflicts and contradictions.\\n\\nIt shows how news and opinion is blurred – but opinion wins – and the lengths the network goes to ensure a devoted audience. Fox is a shameless counterfeit of a news organization, and Fox & Friends leads the fraud bright and early every morning.', 'What is Johnson’s deal, do MPs back it, will there be an election – and what does it all mean?\\n\\nIt was nearly the end of the beginning of Brexit. Nearly, but not yet. More than 1,200 days after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Boris Johnson had a deal accepted (in principle) by the House of Commons – a victory that eluded Theresa May three times.\\n\\nIn a dramatic half-hour at Westminster on Tuesday night, MPs voted in favour of the Brexit deal but rejected the prime minister’s shotgun timetable to pass the bill that would make it possible. At that moment it was clear the UK would not leave the EU on Johnson’s “do or die” date of 31 October with a deal. Time had run out.\\n\\nParliament’s demand for scrutiny meant the EU had to give serious consideration to Johnson’s grudging request for a further Brexit delay, which dropped into the inbox of the EU council president, Donald Tusk, late last Saturday night. The EU decided to grant the extension but is yet to decide how long it should be.\\n\\nNeither the exasperated EU nor the prime minister can guarantee if or when parliament will give its final assent to the deal.\\n\\nThis week’s fractious, often angry debate in the Commons was a prologue to the second act of Brexit and revealed there is no consensus on the future. Parliament was ready to vote Brexit means Brexit, but has not agreed what Brexit means.\\n\\nWhat is Boris Johnson’s deal?\\n\\nAfter a summer of brinkmanship and bad-tempered exchanges between Brussels and London, Boris Johnson struck a deal with the EU on 17 October. The prime minister made three key concessions.\\n\\nFirst, to solve the long-running dispute over the Irish border, he agreed to customs checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and an all-Ireland regulatory zone for goods. In other words, he agreed to a border in the Irish Sea, a line he said in 2018 he would not accept.\\n\\nSecondly, he dropped his insistence that the Conservative’s coalition partners, the Democratic Unionist party, should be able to veto those arrangements. The EU also gave way, by allowing the Northern Ireland assembly to vote to quit the economic arrangements by a simple majority, although no one expects it to do so. The original plan to create a temporary insurance policy to avoid a hard border mutated into a permanent arrangement separating Northern Ireland economically from Great Britain. The backstop became a full stop.\\n\\nThe final piece of the jigsaw was the non-binding political declaration that charts a course for future relations between the EU and UK. Abandoning May’s hopes for close economic ties, the two sides will now work towards a looser free-trade agreement. The prime minister was not successful in trying to drop a link between a free-trade deal and commitments to maintain existing EU standards on workers’ rights and environmental standards. But these guarantees were moved from the legal text to the non-binding declaration and the UK will not seek to match any raising of EU standards.\\n\\nFive days is a long time in politics\\n\\nMPs convening in the Commons for the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands war had been expected to deliver a decisive verdict on Johnson’s deal. Instead, they asked for more time. A majority of MPs supported an amendment from the former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin designed to prevent an accidental no-deal before 31 October.\\n\\nThe prime minister was forced to request an extension, obeying the law as the government had always said he would, despite a stream of off-record briefings that No 10 had a secret plan to evade extension. But Johnson sent the EU three letters, including an unsigned one requesting the extension and a second arguing against a delay.\\n\\nEurope reacted with exasperation that MPs had passed on the chance to make a choice. Meeting on a drizzly Sunday morning in Brussels, EU diplomats decided to press on with the EU’s own ratification. The extension letter was left in the inbox.\\n\\nBy Tuesday, the EU’s hopes of quick resolution were dashed. The House of Commons voted to back Johnson’s deal by 30 votes but rejected the timetable that would have seen parliament consider the 115-page withdrawal agreement bill in just three days – an accelerated process described as “insulting” in the Commons and “absurd” by an EU diplomat.\\n\\nEven the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, had not mastered all the details. He told MPs (wrongly) that there would be no customs declarations required to send goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. He later corrected himself.\\n\\nThe EU’s wait-and-see policy could no longer hold. Tusk, an anglophile who hopes the UK will one day rejoin, recommended the EU accept the British request to extend Brexit until 31 January, as requested by the Commons. In sticking to parliament’s request, he hoped the EU could avoid accusations of siding with Brexiters (by offering a short extension) or remainers (by offering a longer one).\\n\\nBy Wednesday, EU member states had unanimously accepted the prime minister’s request for an extension. While most were ready to support a delay until 31 January, France was holding up a decision. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hopes that a shorter delay might force a decision at Westminster. It was Macron’s earlier insistence on forcing the pace that created the countdown to 31 October when the EU debated the second Brexit extension in April.\\n\\nWhat happens next?\\n\\nThe EU is likely to grant a Brexit extension while continuing to complain about the disruptive neighbour that won’t leave. But the next steps from Westminster are less sure. The prime minister could pass the withdrawal agreement bill within a few weeks, possibly days. The pro-EU former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke said the prime minister needed only “a modest adjustment” of the timetable.\\n\\nBut as Labour and the Conservatives have been unable to agree a revised timetable for the bill, it could take weeks, even months. As time passes, different factions could mobilise behind their preferred Brexit. Labour MPs will press for a customs union and stronger protection for workers and the environment. Hardline Eurosceptics have signalled they want more oversight over payments to the EU.\\n\\nAs details emerge from dense legal text, the government’s fragile coalition of Eurosceptic “Spartans”, former Tories and 19 Labour MPs risks fracturing. It cannot be ruled out that the government could lose the majority for Johnson’s Brexit deal in the final vote.\\n\\nAll three options are likely to be accompanied by a general election, with the prime minister urging MPs to agree to go to the polls on 12 December. Another EU referendum looks a remote possibility but cannot be excluded until Brexit happens.\\n\\nQuick guide How can Boris Johnson get a general election before January? Show Hide A motion for a general election Boris Johnson has three options to try and call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election may be called if it is agreed by two-thirds of the total number of MPs. Johnson presented motions for an election on 4 and 9 September and failed on both occasions when the majority of Labour MPs abstained. Johnson could try this again and potentially secure Labour backing, because the Benn act has removed the imminent possibility of a no-deal Brexit. A one-line bill This lowers the threshold of MPs needed to trigger a general election because it requires a simple majority to pass. This could work in Johnson’s favour. However, it is amendable, which can involve the moving of an election date to a time that works for the opposition. A no-confidence motion The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, can call a no-confidence motion in the prime minister. This needs a simple majority to pass. He has been urged to do this by Johnson several times as a way of triggering an election, but Corbyn has resisted. It begins a 14-day period in which either the prime minister or someone else can try to form a new government. While Johnson could potentially lose this, and therefore his place as prime minister, to another Conservative, Corbyn could also struggle to get enough MPs to rally around him to form a government. The Scottish National party has said it would back him, but the Liberal Democrats have been extremely vocal in saying they would not support him. An election is triggered if, at the end of the two-week period, no alternative government has been formed. Kate Proctor Political correspondent\\n\\nWhether it is an election or a referendum campaign, the prime minister will champion himself as the man who wants to or has succeeded in his efforts to “get Brexit done”. The slogan might as well be written on the side of a bus.\\n\\nThe day after departure, talks will enter a new phase as the UK seeks to strike a free-trade deal with the EU, as well as numerous other agreements on crime-fighting, foreign policy and data protection, to name a few. Almost immediately after the political trauma of exit, the UK will be plunged into a new cycle of deadlines and demands, countdowns and cliff-edges as it seeks to find a new place in the world.', 'From the hunger strike to the edible projectile, history offers abundant examples of food being used for political ends. Even so, the crowd of vegans who gathered in central London earlier this year are unlikely to forget the moment when Gatis Lagzdins skinned and ate a raw squirrel.\\n\\nAlong with his co-conspirator Deonisy Khlebnikov, Lagzdins performed his stunt at the weekly Soho Vegan Market on Rupert Street. He would subsequently demonstrate at VegFest in Brighton (although this time his snack of choice was a raw pig’s head) as part of a self-proclaimed “carnivore tour” intended to highlight the evils of a plant-based diet. At the London event, he wore a black vest emblazoned with the slogan: “Veganism = Malnutrition.”\\n\\nThe war on vegans started small. There were flashpoints, some outrageous enough to receive press coverage. There was the episode in which William Sitwell, then editor of Waitrose magazine, resigned after a freelance writer leaked an email exchange in which he joked about “killing vegans one by one”. (Sitwell has since apologised.) There was the PR nightmare faced by Natwest bank when a customer calling to apply for a loan was told by an employee that “all vegans should be punched in the face”. When animal rights protesters stormed into a Brighton Pizza Express in September this year, one diner did exactly that.\\n\\nA charge commonly laid against vegans is that they relish their status as victims, but research suggests they have earned it. In 2015, a study conducted by Cara C MacInnis and Gordon Hodson for the journal Group Processes & Intergroup Relations observed that vegetarians and vegans in western society – and vegans in particular – experience discrimination and bias on a par with ethnic and religious minorities.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Lee Martin/Guardian Design\\n\\nOnce a niche interest group parodied in TV shows such as The Simpsons (in which a character describes himself as a “level five vegan” who refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow), in the past two years, vegans have been thrust into the limelight. A philosophy rooted in non-aggression has found itself at the heart of some of the most virulent arguments on social media. In November 2018, Good Morning Britain hosted a debate titled “Do people hate vegans?”; the political website Vox tackled the question in even more direct fashion a week later, asking: “Why do people hate vegans so much?”\\n\\nThese recent displays of enmity towards vegans represent a puzzling escalation in hostilities, just as a consensus is starting to form that eating less meat would almost certainly be better for everyone – and the Earth. Of course, eating less meat does not mean eating no meat whatsoever, and the extreme prohibitions associated with going vegan (no animal products, no eggs, no leather, no wool) suggest it could have been just another Atkins diet or clean-eating fad – a flash in the pan that blows up and then dissipates, leaving behind nothing more than a dose of mild regret. Instead, just when the growth might have been expected to plateau, it kept on growing. A 2016 Ipsos Mori survey suggested the total number of vegans in the UK had increased more than 360% in the preceding decade, to more than 500,000.\\n\\nBig business has been quick to cash in. The Los Angeles-based company Beyond Meat, producer of plant-based burgers whose taste and texture are as much like minced beef as possible, recently went public and soon afterwards hit a valuation of $3.4bn; huge conglomerates such as Nestlé and Kellogg’s are moving into the fake-meat market; supermarkets and restaurant chains have introduced vegan ranges. Yet perhaps the definitive proof of veganism’s mainstreaming – and the backlash against it – came in January this year, when the beloved high-street bakery chain Greggs announced it was launching a Quorn-based vegan sausage roll. It was pilloried by Piers Morgan, who tweeted: “Nobody was waiting for a vegan bloody sausage, you PC-ravaged clowns.” It turns out Morgan was mistaken: the vegan sausage roll was such a hit that the company’s share value leapt by 13%.\\n\\nOf course, what we grow, harvest, fatten and kill is political. A Tesco advert showcasing vegan produce met protests from the National Farmers Union who claimed it “demonised” meat, while Shropshire deputy council leader Steve Charmley unleashed a tweet-storm when confronted with pro-vegan advertising in a county he claimed was “built on agriculture”. This moment, and this conflict, were a long time coming. The rise of veganism is a question less of personal taste than of generational upheaval; less about meat and fish and dairy than the systems that put them on our tables in such excessive quantities. Ultimately, the vegan wars are not really about veganism at all, but about how individual freedom is coming into conflict with a personal and environmental health crisis.\\n\\nIn many cultures, the practice of abstaining entirely from animal produce has an established history: with their belief systems rooted in nonviolence, many Rastafarians, followers of Jainism and certain sects of Buddhism have been swearing off meat, fish, eggs and dairy for centuries. In large swathes of the west, though, public awareness of what veganism actually entails has been sketchy. There wasn’t even a commonly accepted English-language name until 1944, when a British woodworker called Donald Watson called a meeting with a handful of other non-dairy vegetarians (including his wife, Dorothy) to discuss a less cumbersome label for their lifestyle. They considered alternatives such as dairyban, vitan and benevore before settling on the term we use today, a simple contraction of vegetarian on the grounds that “veganism starts with vegetarianism and carries it through to its logical conclusions”.\\n\\nBut those logical conclusions did not stop at abstaining from certain foods. The original vegans were not pursuing a diet so much as a belief system, a wholesale ideology – one that rejected not just animal protein but also the way animals had become part of an industrial supply chain. In the 1970s, Carol J Adams started work on the book that would appear, two decades later, as The Sexual Politics of Meat: a seminal feminist text that positioned veganism as the only logical solution to a social system that reduced both women and animals to desirable, but disposable, flesh.\\n\\nIn the early 70s, other activists were considering how veganism might provide a viable alternative to existing food systems. In 1971, Diet for a Small Planet by the social policy activist Frances Moore Lappé introduced an environmental justification for going vegetarian or vegan to a global audience (it eventually sold more than 3m copies). In the same year, counter-culture hero Stephen Gaskin founded a vegan intentional community, The Farm, in Lewis County, Tennessee, bringing together some 300 like-minded individuals. Four years later, The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook by Louise Hagler announced: “We are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night,” and introduced western audiences to techniques for making their own soy-based products such as tofu and tempeh.\\n\\nThe Farm Vegetarian Cookbook fixed a certain vegan aesthetic in the minds of mainstream meat-eating culture for decades to come. Veganism became synonymous with soybeans and brown rice, with ageing hippies spooning beige bowlfuls of worthy grains and pulses – not the glamorous, vibrant, youthful practitioners that now radiate positivity from their Instagram feeds.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest BBQ pulled jack fruit tacos with avocado and lime: a long way from the beige vegan food much parodied in the 70s. Photograph: LauriPatterson/Getty Images/iStockphoto\\n\\nIt is hard to overstate the role social media has played in transforming veganism’s image, with its facility for fostering an instant sense of community. Witness any number of viral internet phenomena – from Woman Laughing Alone with Salad to acai bowls and this generation’s staple, avocado toast – that have helped free it from its musty old associations. Instagram in particular gave vegan food mainstream exposure, repackaging it (good for you and photogenic!) for the low-attention-span internet age. Not everyone sees this as a positive development: the vegan writer and podcast host Alicia Kennedy considers it troubling that the internet has transformed something with such a rich political history into “a wellness thing” that allows would-be consumers to label themselves vegans without having to engage with the “excess baggage” of ideology. Another American writer, Khushbu Shah, has argued that the popularisation of veganism via social media has erased non-white faces and narratives from the dominant discourse, as white bloggers and influencers fashion a lifestyle in their image.\\n\\nAt the same time, a similar transformation was happening to the food vegans were eating. A blossoming street food scene in major cities influenced a dirtier, trashier vegan aesthetic that gave the diet a further boost. Recipe channels on YouTube and Facebook such as BOSH! – a glossy young male duo – used video to make stunt dishes (apple pie tacos; a plant-based take on a McDonald’s McMuffin; a watermelon “Jaegerbomb”) that injected some much-needed fun into the diet. (Tellingly, the BOSH! dudes, Henry Firth and Ian Theasby, refer to themselves not as chefs but “food remixers”.)\\n\\nThe language began to reflect a new, more approachable veganism. Descriptors such as “plant-based” gained in popularity, effectively rebranding the worthy brown stodge of popular imagination into something green and vital. Other neologisms such as “flexitarian” (a term denoting someone who is predominantly vegan or vegetarian but who occasionally eats meat or fish, added to the Oxford English Dictionary in June 2014) recast daunting vegan ideology as a fun, healthy, casual thing to try.\\n\\nCultish initiatives like Veganuary (an annual campaign encouraging people to go meat-free for the first month of the year, launched in 2014) and Meat Free Mondays tapped into this spirit – moving away from wholesale dietary transformation and towards something more manageably sporadic, with the added gloss of being able to share (that is, brag about) the experience online. Beyoncé declared an interest in veganism – at least, for breakfast – while athletes such as Venus Williams (who took up a raw vegan diet to combat a health condition) and Lewis Hamilton played a vital role in raising awareness and turning something once seen as weird and a little annoying into a desirable lifestyle.\\n\\nGet the Guardian’s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\\n\\nHelping the cause was the growing body of scientific literature suggesting that some of the processes that produce the modern western diet were catastrophically bad for us. Bee Wilson wrote in these pages about the health effects of processed pork in a piece titled “Yes, bacon really is killing us.” Food in the Anthropocene, a report commissioned by the Lancet in conjunction with the global nonprofit Eat (a startup dedicated to transforming the global food system) concluded that “unhealthy diets are the largest global burden of disease”, and that meat-heavy food production is “the largest source of environmental degradation”. A major study led by a team from Oxford University, published in the journal Nature in October 2018, showed that huge reductions in meat-eating are essential to slow the rate of climate change. Livestock production has been shown to lead to dangerous levels of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Factor in pop-science phenomena like the documentaries Cowspiracy! and What the Health – available on Netflix – and your diet suddenly seemed like a way you could save the world.\\n\\nBig Meat continues to lobby aggressively in favour of our God-given right to eat animal flesh, resulting in a series of legal prohibitions surrounding what can and cannot be called “meat”’ or even – in one US state – a “veggie burger”. But veganism’s virality has proved irresistible. From about 2015, vegan and plant-based cookery manuals started to proliferate at a dazzling rate, with the BOSH! boys selling upward of 80,000 copies and spending four weeks on the Sunday Times bestseller list (today, Amazon lists more than 20,000 results for the search term “vegan cookbook”). Sales of plant milks skyrocketed; financial results at the manufacturer of plant-based protein Quorn soared as what one analyst referred to as the “battle for the centre of the plate” began to draw (fake) blood. By 2018, Byron, M&S and Pret had invested heavily in vegan ranges. It was, this paper proclaimed, “the year that veganism moved out of the realms of counter-culture and into the mainstream”. In 2014, Veganuary’s inaugural campaign had attracted just 3,300 participants; by 2019 the number was greater than 250,000, with 53% of them under the age of 35.\\n\\nBut veganism’s explosive growth alone does not explain why it attracted such controversy. There is something inherent to veganism and vegans that arouses deeper feelings. What is it about the vegan lifestyle that stirs such strong emotion in those who don’t happen to share it? Why do people hate vegans so much?\\n\\nEarly attempts to establish a vegan utopia did not go well. In the 1840s, the transcendentalist philosopher Amos Bronson Alcott (father of the author of Little Women, Louisa May) founded Fruitlands in Harvard, Massachusetts – a vegan community intended to be nothing less than a second Eden. But Alcott’s insistence that crops had to be planted and fields tilled by hand meant that not enough food could be grown for all of the members (even though the population peaked at just 13); a diet of fruit and grains, typically consumed raw, left participants severely malnourished. Just seven months after opening, Fruitlands closed – derided, in the words of one biographer, as “one of history’s most unsuccessful utopias”.\\n\\nThe timing was unfortunate for American vegetarians, who were already engaged in a pitched battle with public opinion. Vegetarians and vegans in the 19th century – known as Grahamites after the Presbyterian minister and diet reformer Sylvester Graham, who campaigned against meat-eating on the grounds that it was both unhealthy and morally repugnant – were the subject of frequent vitriolic editorials in the popular and medical press of the day, which described them as “cadaverous”, “feeble”, “half-crazed”, “sour-visaged” and “food cranks”.\\n\\nIn the 21st century the terminology may have changed but the sentiment remains much the same. The 2015 study conducted by MacInnis and Hodson found that only drug addicts were viewed more negatively among respondents. It concluded: “Unlike other forms of bias (eg, racism, sexism), negativity toward vegetarians and vegans is not widely considered a societal problem; rather, [it] is commonplace and largely accepted.”\\n\\nIn 2011, sociologists Matthew Cole and Karen Morgan observed a phenomenon they called “vegaphobia”, demonstrating that the British media consistently portrayed vegans in a negative light. In the days after her story broke, Selene Nelson, the freelancer at the centre of the Waitrose magazine row, was called “humourless”, “combative” and “militant”. In 2017, residents of the Swiss town of Aargau reportedly called for a vegan foreign resident to be denied citizenship because she was “annoying”, and the glee with which the global media retold the story revealed a widespread and casual prejudice.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beyond Meat’s Beyond Spring burger.\\n\\nVeganism’s opponents outline a host of objections to the lifestyle to justify their hostility. Per a now-familiar joke (Q: How do you know if someone’s vegan? A: Don’t worry, they’ll tell you), vegans are portrayed as preachy and sanctimonious, a characteristic that rankled among MacInnis and Hodson’s respondents in particular, who viewed “vegetarians/vegans more negatively when their motivations concern social justice rather than personal health”.\\n\\nThere are rational motives to oppose vegan diets on health grounds. They can be deficient in crucial nutrients such as vitamin B-12. This is especially notable in the case of extreme diets (such as fruitarianism) advocated by some vegan bloggers or Instagram influencers with unorthodox approaches to nutritional science. Various supermarket chains have also attempted to meet the burgeoning demand for vegan products with highly processed vegan ready meals – from the Impossible Burger to plant-based meatballs, goujons and hot dogs. As Bee Wilson argued in these pages, the high proportion of processed ingredients in these products means the so-called health halo they enjoy may well be illusory.\\n\\nPerhaps all we are doing, as veganism truly goes mainstream and companies such as Beyond Meat reap windfalls, is replacing one kind of industrialised system with another. Evidence suggests that intensive livestock farming is a poor solution to world hunger, given its impact on personal health and the environment, but intensive industrialised farming of soya, maize and grains comes at a significant carbon cost, too – as does flying in the ingredients to keep berries and nut butters on acai bowls or avocado on toast.\\n\\nVeganism, of course, is rooted in social justice – a detail that has faded from view as it has gone mainstream. But even in its dilute 21st-century form, veganism remains confrontational: it casts people’s dietary choices in harsh relief, and people are by nature defensive. In countries where meat is prohibitively expensive for many, people are sometimes vegetarian or vegan by necessity; in the affluent west, not eating meat is an active choice. This makes it a rejection of a lifestyle and a rebuke to the majority’s values – especially in a country (such as the UK) still struggling to escape the long shadow of rationing. We are conditioned to like animals and decry animal cruelty, and yet we are also brought up in a culture that revels in the bacon sandwich, the Sunday roast, fish and chips. One simple explanation for why people don’t like vegans is because they show how confused humankind is about food choices and how illogical its decision-making can be.\\n\\nAnd yet none of this really gets to the heart of what it is about vegans that makes people so upset. Calling them humourless or militant, sanctimonious or annoying or hypocrites – all of these terms are just smokescreens for what it is that people really feel, which is fear. Vegans are unsettling and uncanny: they live among us, speak like us, behave like us – but for one significant exception. Meat may be murder, but to some people, the prospect of life without it is even worse.\\n\\nThere is no justification for the amount of meat we eat in western society. The resources that go into humanely rearing and butchering an animal should make its flesh a borderline-unattainable luxury – and, indeed, in the past, it was. Meat always used to be the preserve of the wealthy, a symbol of prosperity: “A chicken in every pot” remained an aspirational but impractical promise across the best part of a millennium, from the days of Henry IV of France (when the term was invented) all the way through to Herbert Hoover’s 1928 presidential campaign.\\n\\nIt was only through the technological advances of modern agriculture that meat became attainable and available at supermarket prices. From the mid-1800s onwards, farmers could raise animals bigger, better and faster than in the past; kill them quicker; treat their flesh to prevent it from spoiling; transport it further and store it longer. A commonly cited psychological turning point was the second world war, which engendered what Russell Baker, writing in the New York Times, later described as a kind of “beef madness”. GIs were sent to the front with rations of tinned meat; once peace had been declared, there was no better symbol of the brave new world than a sizzling celebratory steak. In the course of just over a century, meat went from unattainable luxury to dietary cornerstone; these days, we feel entitled to eat meat every day.\\n\\nIn March this year, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was discussing the Green New Deal on Showtime’s Desus & Mero US TV talk show when she observed: “Maybe we shouldn’t be eating a hamburger for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Like, let’s keep it real.” An apparently innocuous comment, rooted in the same common-sense good science that informed the Lancet report on meat and environmental degradation published around the same time? Not if you asked the Republicans, it wasn’t.\\n\\nRepresentative Rob Bishop of Utah seized on Ocasio-Cortez’s comment, claiming that under the Green New Deal the eating of burgers would be “outlawed”. Former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka went one better, using a speech at the Conservative Political Action conference to proclaim: “They want to take away your hamburgers! This is what Stalin dreamed about but never achieved!”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez announcing the Green New Deal, part of which would aim to reduce meat consumption. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty\\n\\nStalin was, in fact, full of admiration for the American burger, going so far as to send his minister of foreign trade to the US on a fact-finding mission (the result, the so-called Mikoyan cutlet, would remain an affordable Soviet staple for decades). But “they’re taking our meat” is as evocative a rallying cry as “they’re taking our jobs” or “they’re taking our guns” – it conveys the same sense of individual freedoms being menaced by external forces, a birthright under attack. Ted Cruz (wrongly) alleged that his Democrat rival Beto O’Rourke planned to ban Texas barbecue if elected senator in his place: like the personal firearm, animal flesh has become an emblem of resistance against the encroachments of progressivism, something to be prised from your cold, dead hand. Men’s rights advocate Jordan Peterson is famed for following a beef and salt diet; Donald Trump is renowned for his love of fast food and well-done steak with ketchup; there is even a subset of libertarian cryptocurrency enthusiasts who call themselves Bitcoin carnivores.\\n\\nIn the internet age, the consumption of meat is visibly aligned with a certain kind of conservative alpha-masculinity. Before he found infamy eating raw flesh, Gatis Lagzdins was best known for hosting a YouTube channel peddling racist ideology and rightwing conspiracies about the Illuminati. Among the alt-right and affiliated circles online, the derogatory term “soy boy” has been adopted along with other terms such as “cuck” and “beta” as a way of mocking so-called social justice warriors for their perceived lack of vigour. This echoes a finding in the MacInnis/Hodson study, in which respondents from a rightwing background, who seek to uphold traditional gender values, see something alarmingly subversive and worthy of derision in any man who prefers tofu to turkey.\\n\\nThis loaded use of food-derived epithets cuts both ways. In the UK, the term “gammon” gained currency in the early 2010s as a pejorative apparently inspired by the puce skin tone of enraged, middle-aged middle Englanders. Food has always been bound up in personal identity, and thus inextricable from politics. In their etymology, common terms such as “diet” (Greek for way of life) and “regime” (Latin: rule) are metaphors for a struggle over what it means to lead one’s life correctly. The very concept of orthorexia (whose sufferers obsessively exclude foods from their diet that they consider harmful) has at its root a corrupted idea of “correct” eating. It is impossible to talk about diets without also talking about the implied inadequacies of those who do not follow them; to paraphrase Brillat-Savarin, tell someone what to eat and you tell them who to be.\\n\\nThe vegan conversation, then, is a stand-in for much bigger things. When we talk about veganism we are talking about environmental and social change; we are also contemplating the erasure of tradition (Texas barbecue! The Sunday roast! The sausage roll!). We are also tabling a long-overdue referendum on how our food choices affect us and the world around us. And as much as its popularity has been pumped up by concepts like flexitarianism, ultimately veganism’s goal is a world in which the annual per-capita consumption of animal products is precisely zero. No wonder things have got so heated.\\n\\nFood can be a powerful conduit for our anxieties, too. Half a century ago, a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine described a terrifying new condition whose symptoms – headache, sweating, heart palpitations – were associated with a common ingredient of dishes served in Chinese restaurants: monosodium glutamate, or MSG. The flavour-enhancing additive was so demonised that it was banned in some US cities. Despite multiple studies conclusively proving otherwise, the belief in so-called “Chinese restaurant syndrome” remains widespread today: Asian-American chefs still find themselves having to justify the use of MSG despite its widespread use in non-Asian foods too. It is a neat example of the persistence of food-related urban legends. There was no doubt a racist element to the way the MSG myth spread; those involved in its dissemination were also motivated by a gnawing fear of obsolescence as a new threat to their existence began to gain popularity.\\n\\nThose opposing meat-eating have a struggle ahead of them. It is clear that what is at stake here is not steak, but identity. A movement that preaches such wholesale change is bound to stir up anxieties, chief among them the sense that vegan dishes such as the Greggs Quorn sausage roll are being positioned not as alternatives but as replacements.\\n\\nWith a few notable exceptions – most of them religious – meat has retained its primacy in cultures across the world. It originally became a status symbol because it was harder to obtain than plant matter – even a small animal could run away, and if caught, was capable of inflicting wounds that could prove fatal in a world before antibiotics. As society became hierarchical, there was no greater token of status than the ability to eat meat on a whim. In her 2016 book Meathooked, Marta Zaraska records the discovery of Egyptian tombs in which the pharaohs had been buried alongside “meat mummies”, baskets of beef and poultry that had been embalmed in preparation for the afterlife. Our fetishisation of meat has not lessened – on the contrary, forecasters predict rapid increase in meat consumption in developing countries over the next decade. As a ready source of protein, meat remains the great aspiration, the surest proof of prosperity.\\n\\nAs Carol J Adams wrote, the words we use shield us from the moral consequences of carnivory: we eat beef, not cows, pork, not pigs, while a cabbage remains just a cabbage wherever it is in its life cycle. Our language ennobles meat at the expense of veg: strong, muscular types are “beefy”, lazy people are “couch potatoes”, unresponsive ones “vegetables”. Turning our back on meat-eating is not as simple as changing from pork to Quorn: it requires us to reject some entrenched values.\\n\\nAlready, there are signs that a great migration is underway. The UK university caterer Tuco recently reported that record numbers of canteens are going meat-free, describing the adoption of vegan or vegetarian diets among students and staff as a “mega-trend”. On the high street, too, there is a growing recognition that vegan ranges are not just opportunistic cash-grabs but potential best-sellers. After the success of Greggs’ vegan sausage roll, Tesco announced it would be increasing its range of dedicated plant-based products by nearly 50% to keep pace with demand.\\n\\nSales may be growing fast, but they are barely making a dent in the $1.7tr global market for animal-derived protein. Certainly, a change of culture will not happen without the involvement of government, industry and science; as the past few years have shown, widespread change is also unlikely to happen without a fight. This makes the current field of conflict an unfortunate one – in the real world, we can practise moderation, emotional flexitarianism. Online – where many of the vegan wars’ most intense skirmishes are currently being fought – we do not find compromise or even look for it. The internet has made communication highly charged and polarised; the only way to be heard in such a screaming vortex is to shout louder.\\n\\nBut the body of evidence suggesting that we eat too much meat is approaching the point where it becomes undeniable. This summer, a UN report identified destruction of forests and emissions from cattle and other intensive farming practices as major factors driving the climate crisis towards a point of no return.\\n\\nWhite gold: the unstoppable rise of alternative milks Read more\\n\\nSome are proposing urgent action, such as the QC Michael Mansfield, who recently suggested (in a speech given at the launch of the Vegan Now campaign) that meat-eating could become illegal. He drew a parallel with the smoking ban, and it is indeed eminently possible that in time meat (especially red meat) becomes the new tobacco – a vice enjoyed by a small number of people in full awareness of its negative health consequences.\\n\\nBut in coining the term “ecocide” – and classing it as a crime against humanity – Mansfield framed the debate in different terms. We might portray the current moment as a precipice, and the growing interest in plant-based diets as the surest way back to safety. In this interpretation, the war on vegans is the act of a doomed majority fighting to defend its harmful way of life. Vegans might well be vociferous and annoying, holier-than-thou, self-satisfied and evangelical. But as their numbers grow beyond the margins, perhaps the worst thing they could be is right.\\n\\n• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here', 'International correspondent Michael Safi tells Anushka Asthana how he tracked down five brothers separated by the war in Syria.

Anything else will be a huge political error. Boris Johnson’s current offer – more time to debate his woeful deal in an attempt to triumphantly ram it through parliament before an election – is clearly unacceptable.\\n\\nIt is, in part, an attempt to deflect from his failed commitment to “die in a ditch” if Britain did not leave the EU by the end of the month. More significantly, it reflects an attempt to bridge his own internal split: between the old Vote Leave crew – headed by Dominic Cummings – who are gunning for a general election, and ministers and MPs, who fear it may not pan out too well, with the Tories vulnerable in Scotland, the south-west and English commuter constituencies.\\n\\nIt is reminiscent of April 2017, when advisers such as Nick Timothy pushed for Theresa May to call an election, while politicians such as Cabinet Office minister Ben Gummer were deeply sceptical. In the end, Gummer lost the argument – and his Ipswich seat.\\n\\nMany Labour MPs are fretting about campaigning in the cold and the dark of winter. But what are the alternatives?\\n\\nLabour’s internal debate on this question is not settled. Jeremy Corbyn’s instinct is always to back an election because, as his supporters and critics alike agree, the Labour leader thrives in campaigning mode. In September, he was persuaded – alongside other opposition leaders – to vote against an early election until no deal was taken off the table. But they all failed to predict Boris Johnson capitulating to the EU’s red lines and tossing the DUP into the Irish Sea.\\n\\nThe Tories have been waging an asymmetric election campaign from the bully pulpit of government ever since, and will continue to do so until parliament is dissolved and election broadcasting rules kick in, ensuring fair access to the opposition.\\n\\nThe main reason the Labour leadership is currently “dithering” over an election is that its MPs overwhelmingly oppose one. Among those opposed, there are several factions, with separate (but often overlapping) justifications for refusing an election right now.\\n\\nSome Labour MPs are pushing for a referendum before any election takes place. To put it politely, this is a fantasy. As even dedicated People’s Vote campaigners concede, the numbers in this parliament simply are not there – and even if they were, Johnson would first need to be replaced by a government of national unity, which was always a non-starter. The only hope for a second referendum is for an election to return a Labour-led government, which would then implement its policy for a referendum after gaining a democratic mandate for it.\\n\\nAnother faction consists of Labour MPs representing leave seats who fear a “people versus parliament” election. This isn’t true of all MPs in leave constituencies: Jon Cruddas, Lisa Nandy, Stephanie Peacock and Gloria De Piero (who is standing down, but her would-be successor Natalie Fleet has the same position) are among those lobbying for an election, believing that it is untenable to keep turning one down.\\n\\nAs one put it to me, why will political conditions improve for their colleagues if the party continues to hold out against an inevitable election? May’s hopes of a Tory tide sweeping across working-class communities in the north and Midlands were bitterly disappointed: now a far more privileged establishment candidate has succeeded her, and it is by no means clear why Labour leave voters would defect en masse to the Etonian Tories.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lisa Nandy, the Labour MP for Wigan. Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Features\\n\\nNext there are those who believe that further delay may lead to the disintegration of Johnson’s fragile parliamentary coalition for a deal – which stretches from the hard Tory right to soft-left Labour leavers – because the contradictory promises made to each group will unravel. But surely this will be more likely to happen under the intense scrutiny of an election campaign.\\n\\nAnd then there are others whose strategy can be reduced to the hope that something better will come up. But that is not a strategy, and that “something” is likely to be Johnson eventually ramming through his deal.\\n\\nThe mantra that unites all these Labour factions is the proclamation that we cannot even countenance an election until “no deal is ruled out” – which the leadership is also parroting. But it is impossible to actually do this unless article 50 is revoked – not very likely at the moment – or Johnson’s government is removed.\\n\\nMany Labour MPs are fretting about campaigning in the cold and the dark of winter. But what are the alternatives? January and February are colder than the two months ahead, and although it will begin to get lighter, the sun will set in Manchester on Valentine’s Day at a quarter past five.\\n\\nFinally, there are those Labour MPs who simply want Corbyn out. They believe the life is draining away from his project, they hope that something will come up to displace him, and they fear – just as last time – that an election campaign will consolidate his support inside the party, and maybe even put him in No 10, an outcome they do not regard as likely but dread nonetheless.\\n\\nThis is why the Labour leadership must call the bluff of the parliamentary Labour party – and the whips’ office – and impose a three-line whip to back an election. Labour MPs overwhelmingly opposed May’s gambit in 2017, and yet in the end few rebelled. Even if a substantial number vote for delay this time round, there will be enough MPs voting with the whip to get an early election over the line.\\n\\nBrexit: Corbyn says Johnson must come to parliament to rule out no deal – live news Read more\\n\\nFor those who believe this is a suicide mission, consider this. Dire as Labour’s polling currently is, the Tories were much further ahead in 2017 than they are now. May was far more popular than Johnson: indeed, her approval ratings exceeded those of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair at their zenith. In an election, Labour’s commitment to let the people decide will have the opportunity to cut through – as it becomes clear that this is the only opportunity that remainers have to realise their hopes.\\n\\nAn unquestionably popular domestic agenda – from tax justice to public ownership – will be front and centre again. Corbyn’s campaigning energy can finally be released. Labour’s mass membership can mobilise. Johnson’s one-sided election campaign will end as broadcasting rules cut in, which was a prerequisite to Corbyn’s personal ratings dramatically improving last time. An uptick in political interest means effective pro-Labour social media content can go viral once again. Johnson’s dire Brexit deal can finally be properly scrutinised and unpicked.\\n\\nMight it all go wrong, might Johnson triumph? Yes. But that very real danger will only increase the longer an election is delayed. The only precedent for Labour’s polling dramatically improving is an election campaign. It would be naive not to concede that this recommendation is not fraught with risks; but the alternative has far more. If Labour does not embrace this election – and come out swinging, full of enthusiasm, mobilising its supporters to go into an existential battle – it is likely to regret it.\\n\\n• Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist', 'How many black families have been targeted by undercover police officers? This is the simple question we are still waiting for authorities to answer.\\n\\nMore than five years have passed since Theresa May, then the home secretary, announced a public inquiry following “profoundly shocking” evidence that Met police undercover officers had spied on the grieving parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, as well as their campaign to get justice for their son.\\n\\nDespite Sir John Mitting’s ongoing undercover policing inquiry spending £21m since 2015, public hearings will only commence in the summer of 2020. In July, however, the inquiry did finally manage to publish the fake identity of a black undercover police officer, “Anthony Lewis”, who gathered intelligence on the Lawrences and their supporters.\\n\\nIt has becoming clear the transparency we all want is unlikely to come – unless we push for answers ourselves\\n\\n“Lewis”, like a number of other undercover officers, has admitted he deceived a woman into a long-term relationship while using his fake identity. The exposure of this kind of abusive manipulation has forced senior officers to publicly apologise to other women who were targeted in this way.\\n\\nWhat we still do not know, however, is how many other campaigns like the Lawrences’, led by grieving families and friends seeking justice for their loved ones after a racist murder or a death in police custody, were targeted? Five years ago the police said there were 18 such groups and families, but no full list of those spied on has ever been published – although they said “the majority” were black.\\n\\nOne of the groups that fought for justice for bereaved families was Newham Monitoring Project (NMP), based in east London, which I was an active campaigner with from 1990 – until it was forced to close due to a lack of funds in 2015. Its focus was on providing practical and legal support to victims of racist violence and the oppressive policing of black communities in east London.\\n\\nOver that period, NMP helped to organise and support numerous campaigns. This included work with the Tamil family of Panchadcharam Sahitharan, who was murdered in Newham in 1992; the death in police custody of Shiji Lapite in Hackney in 1994; Ibrahima Sey’s death in Ilford police station in 1996; all the way through to the aftermath of the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by armed officers at Stockwell police station in 2005 – and the legal battle that followed.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘A black undercover police officer, “ Anthony Lewis”, gathered intelligence on the Lawrences and their supporters.’\\n\\nJust as the families we supported were spied on, the police have subsequently confirmed that NMP, too, was monitored – even though our important work was funded by the local council and the National Lottery.\\n\\nWhy was so much police work put towards spying on the bereaved and their supporters? We are convinced that political policing units and their masters were primarily motivated by a desire to protect the Met’s already damaged reputation: they did so by deliberately trying to portray campaigns seeking truth and accountability as a potential cause of public disorder. This is, unquestionably in our view, a consequence of the police’s institutionally racist attitude to the “threat” posed by racialised communities in the UK.\\n\\nUnfortunately, although some family justice campaigners have been accepted by the undercover policing inquiry as “core participants” in its deliberations, others have not. Instead, they must wait until the inquiry says it finds evidence of spying at a later stage.\\n\\nMost of these campaigners still have no further information. Despite Mitting’s inquiry saying that more than 1,000 groups were targeted, we still have no idea of the true scale of covert intelligence-gathering on black justice campaigns.\\n\\nUK political groups spied on by undercover police – the list Read more\\n\\nThis is why the organisation I work for, the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol) – founded a decade ago by groups including NMP – is launching a campaign with the Undercover Research Group to investigate the question the inquiry refuses to answer: how many black families were targeted by undercover officers? This new investigation aims to expand on work undertaken by the Undercover Research Group last year with the Guardian, which resulted in the publishing of a list of “spycops” targets.\\n\\nAlmost all of these family justice campaigns no longer exist, and so we are hoping that people who once organised or participated in them will get in touch and help us expand on public knowledge of police surveillance on their activities. The annual remembrance procession led by the family and friends of those who have died in the custody of police and prison officers takes place in central London on Saturday.\\n\\nUnfortunately, over the last five years it has becoming increasingly clear that the transparency and fairness we all want is unlikely to come from the inquiry or the police – unless we push for answers ourselves.\\n\\n• Kevin Blowe is coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol)\\n\\nIf you can help, please contact researcher Eveline Lubbers at the Undercover Research Group in confidence at evel@undercoverresearch.net', 'The grindstones of Brexit pound everything else into the ground. Boris Johnson claims day after day that if only parliament would “get it done”, the country would be free to focus again on the NHS, police and schools.\\n\\nBut when the searchlight eventually does fall again on public services, as it likely will in a general election, that may do Johnson and his party no favours. Take Brexit out of the immediate battleground and what’s left? Only the true state of the country and its services after nine long years of funding starvation perpetrated by Conservative governments. Airy promises of shedloads more money from a man not even Tories regard as trustworthy may carry less conviction than the evidence of everyone’s eyes in their own neighbourhoods. As ever, the NHS is the standard bearer for public perceptions of much else. Two particular NHS items stand out as political emblems of this Tory era: the record shortage of nurses, and a particularly bad case of privatisation.\\n\\nStart with the shocking privatisation in 2013 of the NHS blood plasma supplier, on which thousands of patients depend. To protect the quality of the blood product, David Owen, as health secretary in 1975, took blood plasma collection into public ownership as Plasma Resources UK. But Jeremy Hunt, as health secretary, sold that off for £200m to a US private equity firm, Bain Capital, while Britain kept a 20% stake. Co-founded by Mitt Romney in 1984, Bain has over the years acquired such well known health products as Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Dominos Pizza and much else. Protesters, David Owen among them, warned that the company had a predatory reputation for asset stripping, but Bain promised it would develop the company into a “life sciences champion” in Hertfordshire. Instead, it sold it on to a Chinese company in 2016 for £820m. Was there any protest from our government, losing its last remnant of control? Not a word. Instead, an irony, the US government is expressing concern at China taking over a vital US-owned health asset.\\n\\nPrivatisation threats were raised in the debate on the Queen’s speech on Thursday, as Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, pointed to the doubling of NHS expenditure on private health providers since 2010, to £9bn. That’s still not a vast sum out of the NHS budget, but only because the extreme shortage of funds has made core NHS services less tempting for takeover by private companies than the 2012 Health and Social Care Act was designed for. Though NHS England wants its competition elements repealed, the act continues to let companies like Virgin Care sue the NHS when they are denied the chance to tender for profitable contracts. Exhibit number two in the Tories’ destruction of our health service: the NHS has just published its highest ever rate of vacant posts for nurses, at more than 43,000 missing roles. A survey by the Health Service Journal, working from its own FoI requests, finds 93% of NHS trusts are falling short, with nearly half lacking 10% of the nurses they need: that’s three times more than five years ago. Nurses are being substituted with untrained assistants.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Nurse training places fell victim to George Osborne’s first budget: a conveniently commissioned McKinsey report said there would be less need for nurses in future.’ A ward sister oversees a trainee nurse.

But first he must get his deal through | Simon Jenkins Read more\\n\\nNurse training places fell victim to George Osborne’s first budget: a conveniently commissioned McKinsey report said there would be less need for nurses in future. Later came the 2017 abolition of bursaries for trainee nurses, which cut the number of subsequent applicants. That made training unaffordable for women with children, who are often healthcare assistants wanting to upgrade. The attrition of nurses leaving the profession has worsened, with one in five quitting as soon as they train, and 5,000 going back to other EU countries as a result of the Brexit vote. Particular specialisms have been hit hardest. Between 2010 and 2018 there was a 40% drop in learning disability nurses. The Royal College of Nursing points to voluminous research showing not just the fast-rising numbers of patients, but also the increasing complexity and severity of their conditions. Statistically, for every extra nurse who joins the wards, 157 new patients have been admitted over the last five years. The greater the pressure on them, the more prone nurses are to quitting. At the same time many trusts have been downgrading nurses to save money, re-evaluating them from a top pay band 7 to a band 6, doing the same work for a lot less pay, causing many to leave in anger. The health commentator Roy Lilley has been pointing to their loss of some £6,000. Prof Alison Leary of South Bank University warns district nurses are nearing extinction. A nurse loses £10,000 in pay to take a three-year district nurse course: none will qualify in 2021. Both Lilley and Leary suggest that nurturing nurses, supporting them when they start and encouraging them in promotions, could stop their flight from the NHS.\\n\\nAre these tales of privatisation, neglect and cost-cutting the kind of thing Johnson wishes we would all focus on intently once Brexit is “done”? (Not that it ever will be.) If he thinks close coverage of the state of public services is his winning ticket in an imminent election, he may be in for a shock.\\n\\nPromising jam tomorrow will cut no mustard with voters who can see the nine-year plight of services they use today; Johnson’s vague offers are nothing like the money needed to repair them. He might prefer we returned to scrutinising his exceedingly bad Brexit deal.\\n\\n• Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist', 'The conservative website Red State published revenge porn of a sitting congresswoman last week.\\n\\nLindsey Graham introduces resolution condemning impeachment inquiry Read more\\n\\nKatie Hill, of California’s 25th district, found the naked picture of herself published online while she is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce. In an email to supporters, Hill, who was elected as a freshman Democrat in the 2018 midterms, acknowledged a consensual relationship with an aide during her congressional campaign. But she denied another alleged relationship with a different aide, on Capitol Hill, that her ex-husband claims she had.\\n\\nThat latter allegation is not supported by any evidence, but it falls under the purview of the House ethics committee, which has now duly opened an investigation into Hill. Hill is the vice-chairwoman of the House oversight and reform committee, which is central to the impeachment inquiry.\\n\\nWhat Hill admits to – an extramarital affair with a campaign staffer during what she calls “the final tumultuous years” of an “abusive marriage” – isn’t great.\\n\\nIt’s worth pointing out the distinct ethical position of a woman’s abuse of power in this way from a man’s: when Hill engaged in an affair with a campaign aide, she did not do so in the context of millennia of men’s sexual violence against women, and she did not do so with the reasonable ability to threaten force. But acknowledging this does not mean that we must understand such affairs as acceptable.\\n\\nIn her statement, Hill said the relationship with her campaign subordinate was “inappropriate”. I would go further, and call it unethical.\\n\\nStill, Hill’s own conduct – tacky, unprofessional, and ill-advised as it was – pales in comparison to what is being done to her, which amounts to a misogynist rightwing smear campaign. The publication of the nude photograph belies any claim Red State and other Republicans may make to being concerned about the ethics of Hill’s conduct. Instead, what Hill’s attackers seem interested in is a wholesale discrediting of the congresswoman, complete with psychological abuse, public humiliation, and misogynist cruelty of the kind that is all too common an experience for women, from the most vulnerable to the most powerful among them. The fact that Hill is not a perfect victim should not distract us from the true issue at hand: that Red State and its rightwing compatriots have brought the tactics of domestic abuse into our politics.\\n\\nRevenge porn, an increasingly common tactic of misogynist rancor, is not par for the acrimonious political course. It is a particularly hateful gesture, meant to humiliate and degrade its target. The very point of revenge porn is to discredit its victims, because in the misogynist logic that propels it, for a woman to have sex is to surrender her claims to privacy, authority, or the belief or sympathy of others.\\n\\nWhat Hill’s attackers want us to think is that if she was worthy of being a congressperson, she wouldn’t be having sex at all. It is up to us to say that a woman’s sexual life does not discount her other virtues, does not make her worthy of public ridicule, and certainly not of the ugliness of having her nude photo published without her consent on the website of a national media outlet. Revenge porn also happens to be illegal. Hill has asked police to investigate who gave the image to Red State.\\n\\nThe rightwing media is enjoying this all tremendously. They’ve engaged in a days-long feeding frenzy around the ex-husband’s accusations against Hill, emphasizing Hill’s youth (she is 32) and sexuality (she identifies as bisexual) in an attempt to titillate their largely old, white and male audience. But what they are really delighting in is the seeming contraction between what they view as the indignity of sexuality and the dignity of power. They think that having sex – or, perhaps, being a woman at all – should disqualify women from the latter.\\n\\nWhat is afoot is not an attempt to ensure the ethical exercise of a congressmember’s power, but an unethical attempt to humiliate, intimidate and smear a congressmember using sexist tropes to imply that as a woman, she is not eligible for power at all. Women have always had to answer for this sexist assumption, the idea that there is somehow a contradiction between their sexuality and their dignity, or their intelligence. Hill, for her part, describes her ex-husband as abusive. We do not know where the nude picture of her came from, but if he was the one who sent it in for publication, then that description would seem accurate.', 'It’s a Saturday morning and I’m still in bed. My partner is downstairs, reading. We are house-sitting for some friends in a small village outside of Cambridge; it’s a nice break, given the hectic last few months of our lives. I roll over, check my phone, open Twitter. Oh no, I think: again?\\n\\nIt had just been reported that Trinity Hall college at Cambridge University had changed its agreement with former lecturer Dr Peter Hutchinson. Previously it had been agreed that he would not attend undergraduate social events and retire, after 10 women submitted complaints of sexual harassment against him (Hutchinson apologised for his “inappropriate” behaviour). Hutchinson has now had his dining rights as an Emeritus fellow reinstated, and is allowed to attend certain college events once more.\\n\\nCambridge has come under scrutiny this summer after a change in its definition of sexual harassment, so that it no longer included sexual misconduct. This change has been described as “unlawful” by legal experts and advocacy groups – and has resulted in at least two complaints being dropped. Shortly after this, I went public with my experience of the university’s disciplinary procedures after I made a complaint of sexual harassment against one of my supervisors, and spoke about the subsequent legal case I am taking against them.\\n\\nInstitutions have the freedom to create procedures run by academics who are not qualified to investigate complaints\\n\\nAs I read further about the case at Trinity Hall, I experienced a sense of deja vu, even though my experience was at a different college and I submitted my complaint to the university rather than my college. Decisions are shrouded in secrecy: the women who complained about Hutchinson weren’t informed of this change to Trinity Hall’s agreement, and similarly, I was denied access to the majority of the documentation pertaining to my case. These decisions suggest a lack of proper regard for student safety: Hutchinson is allowed back to certain events, just as the supervisor I complained about was allowed to continue teaching. Finally, women in the Hutchinson case were told not to discuss it with the student body, just as I was threatened with disciplinary action if I spoke about my case.\\n\\nSince going public, I have received messages from about a hundred students – current and former students of Cambridge, and some from other universities – recounting similar experiences ranging from dissatisfaction with, to additional trauma from, the way that higher education institutions deal with complaints of sexual misconduct. The decision made this week by Trinity Hall echoes the decision made by Warwick University to reverse the 10-year campus ban placed on students who had sent messages about raping and assaulting women, including fellow students.\\n\\nI wasn’t surprised to hear that Trinity Hall had changed its agreement with Hutchinson: it seems to me this isn’t an exception, but the rule. Hutchinson isn’t a one-off “bad apple”, the whole system is rotting.\\n\\nReports of sexual misconduct in UK higher education are on the rise. But that isn’t the scandal here – we want students to be reporting these incidences, so that they can be properly investigated and dealt with. The scandal is that that isn’t happening. At best, complaints procedures are lengthy, tiring and dissatisfying. At worst, they subject vulnerable students to revictimisation, retaliation and retraumatisation. There is often no provision for appealing the decision: in my case, I had no right of appeal at all.\\n\\nCambridge harassment row fuels calls to reform college system Read more\\n\\nUniversities are failing in their duty of care to provide fair, transparent and accessible disciplinary procedures. They are failing victims largely because they can; thus far there have been no consequences to their institutional failures, which allows their fear of tackling the prolific issue of sexual misconduct on their campuses to dominate. In the Trinity Hall case, the college is an autonomous legal entity from Cambridge University, and Cambridge has denied any responsibility for the college’s decisions. Similarly, UK universities and colleges have not been held accountable for their inaction.\\n\\nThere exists no compulsory, standardised procedure for investigating sexual misconduct in higher education, and this gives institutions the freedom to create quasi-legal procedures often run by poorly trained, over-worked academics who are not qualified to investigate such complaints. Despite a claim by the Office for Students – the independent regulator of higher education in England – that it would intervene in “serious examples of universities failing to address these issues seriously”, this has yet to transpire, despite the major failings we’ve seen.\\n\\nI wasn’t surprised when I read about what happened at Trinity Hall. Until there is legislation that outlines how these procedures must be run, universities will not be an environment in which victims can find justice.\\n\\n• Danielle Bradford is a former student of Cambridge University. She is suing the university for discrimination', 'Although the results of climate research have been consistent for decades, climate scientists have struggled to convey the gravity of the situation to laypeople outside their field. If anything, the wider public only recently seems to have awakened to the threat of the climate crisis. Why?\\n\\nIn our new book, Discerning Experts: The Practices of Scientific Assessment for Public Policy, we attempted to illuminate how scientists make the judgments they do. In particular, we wanted to know how scientists respond to the pressures, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, that arise when they know that their conclusions will be disseminated beyond the research community – in short, how scientists are affected when they know the world is watching.\\n\\nWe explored these questions with respect to assessments of acid rain, ozone depletion and sea level rise predictions from the west Antarctic ice sheet.\\n\\nWhile climate skeptics and deniers often accuse scientists of exaggerating the threats associated with the climate crisis, the available evidence suggests the opposite. By and large, scientists have either been right in their assessments, or have been unduly conservative. We noticed a clear pattern of underestimation of certain key climate indicators, and therefore underestimation of the threat of climate disruption. When new observations of the climate system have provided more or better data, or permitted us to re-evaluate earlier conclusions, the findings for ice extent, sea level rise and ocean temperature have generally been worse than previously thought.\\n\\nOne of the factors that appears to contribute to this trend of underestimation is the perceived need for consensus, or what we call “univocality”: the felt need to speak in a single voice.\\n\\nMany scientists worry that if they publicly air their disagreement, government officials will conflate their differences of opinion with ignorance and use this as justification for inaction.\\n\\nOthers worry that even if policy-makers want to act, they will find it difficult to do so if scientists fail to send an unambiguous message. Therefore, scientists actively seek to find their common ground, and to focus on those areas of agreement. In some cases, where there are irreconciliable differences of opinion, scientists may say nothing, giving the erroneous impression that nothing is known.\\n\\nHow does the pressure for univocality lead to underestimation? Consider a case in which most scientists think that the correct answer to a question is in the range one to 10, but some believe that it could be as high as 100. In this case, everyone will agree that it is at least one to 10, but not everyone will agree that it could be as high as 100. Therefore, the area of agreement is one to 10, and this will be reported as the consensus view. Wherever there is a range of possible outcomes that includes a long, high-end tail of probability, the area of overlap will lie at or near the low end.\\n\\nWe are not suggesting that every example of under-estimation is caused by the factors we observed in our work, nor that the demand for consensus always leads to underestimation. But we found that this pattern occurred in all of the cases that we studied. We also found that the institutional aspects of assessment, including who the authors are and how they are chosen, how the substance is divided into chapters, and guidance emphasizing consensus, also generally tilt in favor of scientific conservatism.\\n\\nKnowing this, what do we do?\\n\\nTo scientists, we suggest that you should not view consensus as a goal. Consensus is an emergent property, something that may come forth as the result of scientific work, discussion and debate. When that occurs, it is important to articulate the consensus as clearly and specifically as possible. But where there are substantive differences of opinion, they should be acknowledged and the reasons for them explained. Scientific communities should also be open to experimenting with alternative models for making and expressing group judgments, and to learning more about how policy makers actually interpret the findings that result. Such approaches may contribute to assessments being more useful tools as we face the reality of adapting to the climate crisis and the disruptions that will occur.\\n\\nFor political leaders and business people, we think it is important for you to know that it is extremely unlikely that scientists are exaggerating the threat of the climate crisis. It is far more likely that things are worse than scientists have said. We have already seen that the impacts of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are unfolding more rapidly than scientists predicted. There is a high likelihood that they will continue to do so, and that the IPCC estimates – that emissions must be rapidly reduced, if not entirely eliminated, by 2050 – may well be optimistic. The fact that this conclusion is hard to swallow does not make it untrue.\\n\\nAnd for ordinary citizens, it is important to recognize that scientists have done their job. It is now up to us to force our leaders to act upon what we know, before it is too late.', 'To be hailed as a truly great tournament this Rugby World Cup needs at least one epic knockout occasion. And here it comes, thundering out of the tunnel at full throttle with its headlights blazing bright. It is 12 years since New Zealand last lost a World Cup game but their onrushing semi-final with England could prove an era-defining fixture.\\n\\nDodge the approaching white bullet train and the All Blacks will be just 80 minutes away from becoming the first team in history to win three consecutive Webb Ellis Cups. The final would still await but, having beaten South Africa in the pool stages and not lost to Wales for 66 years, there would be legitimate grounds for optimism. Win again and, with three World Cup successes, captain Kieran Read, Sam Whitelock and Sonny Bill Williams would even edge beyond all-time greats like Richie McCaw and Dan Carter.\\n\\nThe big kick-off: England playmakers hold the key to beating New Zealand | Ugo Monye Read more\\n\\nIt makes them uniquely dangerous opponents, not least in a land where All Black replica shirts sell particularly well. Consider, though, the flip side of the Kiwi two-dollar coin. In terms of generating fresh interest and momentum in England, a red rose victory would transcend anything since 2003. For the most united squad to have worn the national jersey since those halcyon days, victory would also validate some of the less cosy aspects of Eddie Jones’s relentless regime.\\n\\nAt a stroke it would triumphantly justify four years of training field sweat and, perhaps even more crucially for the Rugby Football Union, transform global perceptions of English rugby. For anyone in their mid teens or younger, World Cups have so far yielded only furrowed brows, ferry frolics and frustration. If those three f’s can be replaced with fast, furious and fun, Twickenham’s bank overdraft will disappear soon enough.\\n\\nHow, then, to make it happen? Just two England teams, in 1973 and 2003, have ever beaten the All Blacks away from Twickenham and there is no World Cup precedent. The mind’s eye, instead, still spools back to Jonah Lomu gathering pace in front of the Newlands press box in 1995 before stampeding over a helpless Mike Catt to set the instant tone in the only previous semi-final between these sides. If ever there was a moment for an Englishman to make a similarly dramatic impact, this is it.\\n\\nOr, to be strictly accurate, 23 Englishmen. While New Zealand have played the more dazzling rugby so far, there might just be a collective glimmer of hope for Jones’s tight-bonded squad. England’s strengths lie in their defensive organisation, their close-quarters strength, their improving discipline and their rising self belief. Add in Owen Farrell’s goal-kicking and perhaps the odd drop goal from George Ford and they will hope to squeeze the All Blacks until even Gladys Knight’s old backing band start to squeak. As Jones pithily put it: “We want to write the script. We don’t want to be watching it, we’ve got to be in there writing it.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eddie Jones wants his team to take the initiative in Yokohama. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\\n\\nSomething similar clearly worked for the British and Irish Lions in New Zealand two years ago, notwithstanding the 25th-minute dismissal of Williams in the pivotal second Test in Wellington. Steve Hansen and his players will encounter many of the same faces – Farrell, Maro Itoje, Mako Vunipola, Jamie George, Kyle Sinckler, Anthony Watson and Elliot Daly – plus a couple of impressive fresh ones in Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. To suggest that, somehow, England will fold like a scout tent at the first hint of pressure is fanciful.\\n\\nSo the first part of the equation is simple: get ahead of New Zealand and try and make them force the odd pass, scuff a clearance or two and generally start to fray at the edges. No one in the right mind would ever describe Ardie Savea and the rejuvenated Read as easy touches but if Billy Vunipola finally comes good and Manu Tuilagi finds half a yard of daylight they should propel their team over the gainline. In that event even Richie Mo’unga and Beauden Barrett will have fewer opportunities to weave their black magic and the odds on the referee, Nigel Owens, awarding England kickable penalties may slightly improve.\\n\\nDo not try and copy the slick, digital-age All Blacks, in short, just throw the whole printer at them for 80 minutes. While Hansen has stacked his side’s lineout by picking Scott Barrett on the blindside flank, Jones does not believe the switch will prove decisive on its own. “Generally in rugby I’ve found that if you go into a game with a perceived strength it doesn’t always happen. You don’t know how many lineouts there are going to be in the game. It might be a game of 15 lineouts, it might be a game of 10 lineouts. Why worry about things you don’t know about?”\\n\\nThe better way forward, as even Namibia have shown at this World Cup, is to be proactive, forceful and fearless with the ball and persistent irritants without it. England were in possession for just over 10 minutes in their quarter-final against Australia and still won 40-16, demonstrating their improving ability to turn turnovers into points. This time they will be looking to Ford to provide clever little grubbers and diagonal kicks in addition to aiming a few time-honoured high balls at Beauden Barrett, Sevu Reece and George Bridge. If there is not at least one score in this game courtesy of an accurate cross-kick it will be a considerable surprise.\\n\\nEddie Jones urges England to beat All Blacks and ‘change history’ Read more\\n\\nHopefully, for the sake of all concerned, the pitch will be rather drier than it was for England’s eve-of-game captain’s run; much more rain and there would have been koi carp swimming in the 22. It would be a shame to see the haka performed in masks and snorkels but, either way, Farrell wants his side to display the controlled aggression that has become their trademark and to be energised, rather than cowed, by the looming challenge. “I don’t think we have to pull any rabbits out of the hat,” said England’s captain. “We want to play the way that suits us and so far this tournament we have been doing all right with that.”\\n\\nThings did not turn out awfully well for his father Andy and Ireland against New Zealand last weekend but looking back has never been Farrell Jr’s style. If he and Jones can heave England into a World Cup final at the All Blacks’ expense, they will see absolutely no reason why they cannot go all the way. Belief is fundamental to any epic heavyweight contest and England genuinely feel ready to rumble.', 'What term do you want to search? Search with google', 'Warren Gatland was asked after announcing his team to face South Africa the single biggest difference he had made since being appointed Wales’s head coach 12 years ago. He took his time before replying, although his response to the previous question, how his players had developed the mentality to see out tight matches rather than throw them away, would have been fitting.\\n\\n“Respect for what we have done is the biggest thing,” he eventually said. “What I am most proud of is that we have earned the respect of the rest of the world which I am not sure was there before given where we were in the world rankings (10th). We have won championships and grand slams.” He paused before adding: “I would love to beat the All Blacks, one thing I have not achieved.”\\n\\nSemi-final return of Jonathan Davies softens Liam Williams blow for Wales Read more\\n\\nHe may have one final opportunity on what would be his last day with Wales, next Saturday, 2 November, when the World Cup final will be played, exactly one week before the 12th anniversary of his appointment by Wales. It would need New Zealand to beat England in the first semi-final before Wales took down South Africa (although if they both lose they will be in a battle for third place the day before), but Gatland’s coaching career, apart from the manner of his departure from Ireland in 2001, after they had been pipped for the Six Nations by England on points difference, has largely been one of dreams fulfilled.\\n\\nWhen he started with Wales, it was reported that Wales’s players had refused to have more than one contact session during the 2007 World Cup, which they exited at the group stage after losing to Fiji. “We will be having plenty of contact sessions,” he said, “and we will break a few players.” He wanted his charges to be physical but also saw that he needed to boost the self-belief of a side that had been mentally fragile. The second task took rather longer to complete than the first.\\n\\nIf W under Gatland has come to stand for win, before him the letter itself reflected the up-and-down nature of the national side: whitewashed in the 2003 Six Nations, they won the grand slam in 2005 and avoided another wooden spoon two years later only with victory over England on the final weekend. Coaches were lucky to last 12 months never mind 12 years, the domestic game was prone to regular upheaval, and success was sporadic because it tended to be achieved by accident rather than design.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest George North was one of the core group of youngsters Gatland began to develop more than a decade ago. Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/REX/Shutterstock\\n\\nGatland changed all that. He learned from his Ireland experience, when at the point he thought he would be offered a new contract he was outmanoeuvred by one of his assistants, Eddie O’Sullivan, and released. His first two appointments were men he had worked with at Wasps and whose loyalty he could be assured of, Shaun Edwards, the defence coach whose fierce competitiveness became quickly engrained in his charges, and Rob Howley. Robin McBryde and Neil Jenkins followed and, until Howley was sent home after a few days here while the Welsh Rugby Union launched an investigation after being approached by a betting company, the team remained together, confounding the theory that fresh voices are needed if one playing dynasty is to follow another.\\n\\nGatland won the grand slam in 2008 at the first attempt, but the next couple of years were his stickiest as he came to terms with the need of his players for direction, different to what he was used to in New Zealand and at Wasps, but he then developed a core group of youngsters – Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau – and moulded them in his own image. They were a missed kick from making the 2011 World Cup final despite playing for an hour against France a man short.\\n\\nHe has never been afraid to test a player early: Warburton was not a regular for Cardiff Blues when Gatland made him captain and in this World Cup he included Rhys Carré, who won his first cap at the end of August in the warm-up against Ireland after a handful of regional starts and the prop will again be on the bench this Sunday having leapfrogged established rivals. Players know that if they impress in training they will be given their chance.\\n\\nThree grand slams and a Six Nations title in 2013, when Gatland was on sabbatical with the Lions, have been supplemented by two World Cup semi-finals: the five tournaments before Gatland had seen two quarter-final appearances and three early exits. Respect has been restored with Wales enjoying their most consistent run of success since the golden era of the 1970s when they were then supported by a buoyant club system rather than four regions who have been unable to make much of an impact in Europe.\\n\\n“Warren’s results on the field with Wales and the Lions speak for themselves,” said South Africa’s director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus. “He is an absolute legend of the game, a gentleman on and off the pitch. You seldom see him in a mud fight before matches. I have never had to reply to something he has said and he does not create unnecessary nonsense before a match. I will see him again with the Lions in 2021 and it is always a pleasure competing with him.”\\n\\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe World Cup is the one trophy that has eluded Gatland. He turned 56 a few days before the start of this tournament and will very probably have another tilt at it, but doing it here would be his crowning achievement, in charge of a side which, on paper, does not look as well equipped as the other three. His brilliance has been in turning a country that prided itself on the exceptional individuals it produced down the decades into a team that runs on maximum output.\\n\\nHe has put his players through it in training and most were made, not broken. South Africa know they will come up against opponents of implacable will. A team that used to fashion various ways of losing a match now does not know when it is beaten: it may wobble but it will not fall down. “Gats has won grand slams, titles and taken Wales to No 1 in the world rankings, but this is the ultimate for him,” said South Africa’s 2007 World Cup winning coach, Jake White. “He will have been giving it to his players this week, telling them they were close to going home.

They’re the only team who have hired a full time go-between to translate every last question and answer, which says plenty about their attention to detail and just as much about their desire to crack the Japanese market. There is a five-minute slot set aside for their questions at the end of every press conference, and over the weeks, there has been one that has come up over and again. It’s the same question we all of us ask at one time or another, the one Eddie Jones is convinced he knows the answer to: ‘What makes you so good?’\\n\\nThis week it was Scott Barrett’s turn to field it. Barrett is not a bad man to ask, because whatever they were doing down on the little dairy farm in Taranaki where he, Beauden, and Jordie grew up it clearly worked. He said it was to do with the ball skills they learned played different sports “cricket, basketball, athletics, hockey” but I prefer his father Kevin’s answer: “It must be something in the milk.” Turns out you really can bottle it. The only surprise is the NZRU haven’t started flogging it. It was only last week that one of their regional partners, Mitsubishi, announced the launch of a limited edition range of All Blacks themed SUVs.\\n\\nThe big kick-off: England playmakers hold the key to beating New Zealand | Ugo Monye Read more\\n\\nThe Barrett boys have been bunking down together this week. Scott and Beauden, who are both in starting XV, have been roommates for the first time since they shared the farm’s four-bed dorm in 2002. “Scott’s clearly got his rugby head on,” Beauden says, “because the other night he was calling out line-out moves in his sleep.” They don’t seem to agree which of them used to get the top bunk back home, except that it definitely wasn’t little brother Jordie, who is on the bench this weekend.\\n\\nThe change of rooms is not the only switch Scott has made lately. He is starting at blindside flanker for the first time too. He usually does most of his training with the locks, but this week he has been a full-time member of the back row. The All Blacks’ management are clearly thinking of that game at Twickenham last November, when England were five points up at half-time. Scott came on in the 50th minute and did such a number on England’s lineout that they lost five of their next 10 throws. New Zealand ended up winning 16-15.\\n\\n“It’s quite nice to be rooming with him,” Scott said, “and to chat about stuff to prepare for this game.” It’s a shrewd move by the management, and clever, too, to stick him in with his big brother before the biggest game of his life. They have got a good understanding of the brothers’ family dynamics, which Dane Coles explains this way: “Jordie is a psycho, because he’s been bullied by Scott. So when we play darts in the team room, Jordie loses his guts when he throws one bad dart. Then Scot’s the one who’s nice and calm, and Baz is in-between. He loses it now and again but he does have that calm karma about him.”\\n\\n“Yeah, we’re all pretty competitive,” Beauden admits. “But you’d probably find more rivalry on the lawn at home in the summertime playing backyard cricket than you would in camp. We all play in different positions so it’s hard to compare.” Jordie might not quite agree with that. He played No 15 in his first seven Tests, but now Beauden’s moved back there, he has been squeezed onto the wing or been busy filling in at fly-half. It can’t be easy competing with your big brother for a spot in the starting XV, especially when he’s the best player in the world.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beauden Barrett (near) and his brother Jordi talk to the media ahead of the semi-final. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\\n\\nTheir dad is pretty damn proud of them all, either way. The boys posed for a photo with him after the quarter-final against Ireland, which he watched from the stands. It has not been an easy few weeks. His father, Ted, died recently, and the boys had to decide whether or not they ought to go back for the funeral. They stayed, and after it was over he flew over to join them. “Last week was a tough week for Dad and for ourselves, so it was awesome to share that moment with him,” Beauden said. “It was obviously a tough time. The team were awesome around supporting us and always giving us the option to head home if that’s what we needed to do.”\\n\\nThe trouble is, Jordie says, that now Kevin’s here he wants to tell them what to do. “I’m sure he’ll try to add his 10 cents in the next couple of days.” Kevin played flanker himself, for Taranaki and the Hurricanes, so Scott has got the worst of it. “As long as he doesn’t follow some of dad’s tactics from ’98. You probably can’t get away with it now.”\\n\\nTruth is, Kevin taught them all he knows a long time ago. When I went to visit the farm back in 2015, he explained that he thinks the big reason why his kids succeeded is that he made them drill the same basic set of skills when they were young, “how to kick with both feet, pass both ways, and run with the ball in both hands”.\\n\\nQuick guide New Zealand team to face England in World Cup semi-final Show Hide New Zealand B Barrett; S Reece, J Goodhue, A Lienert-Brown, G Bridge;\\n\\nR Mo’unga, A Smith; J Moody, C Taylor, N Laulala, B Retallick,\\n\\nS Whitelock, S Barrett, A Savea, K Read.\\n\\nReplacements D Coles, O Tuungafasi, A Ta’avao, P Tuipulotu, S Cane,\\n\\nTJ Perenara, S Williams, J Barrett.\\n\\nBack then, Beauden was still trying to nail down his spot in the All Blacks’ starting XV, Scott had just joined the Crusaders, and Jordie was in his first year at Lincoln University. There are two other brothers as well. Kane, the oldest of the lot, who was playing No 8 for the Auckland Blues until he had to retire because of concussion, and Blake, who is back playing for the local Coastal rugby club. And three sisters too, Jenna, who plays netball for Taranaki, Ella, and Zara, who has Down’s syndrome.\\n\\nBeauden, Jordie, and Scott spoke publicly about that for the first time earlier this year, to help raise awareness of the charity UpsideDowns, who provide funding for speech therapy services for children with Down’s syndrome. “If people could just treat those with Down’s syndrome equally, that’s all I’d ask,” said Beauden. Their parents treated all eight of them exactly the same, he explained. And that goes back to the most important lesson they learned down on the farm, the one that will serve them long after this match has come and gone.\\n\\n“You have got to realise that rugby is just a game, so enjoy it while you are there,” Kevin told me back then. “It’s special, you put a jersey on and play for your province, or get picked for your country and pull on the All Black jersey, that’s a huge honour. But always remember who you are and where you came from, and always keep your feet on the ground. Because the day you take your jersey off you’re just one of us.” You never met a humbler bunch of superstars. Like Coles says: “They’re good people, and they come from a great family.”', 'One of the quirks about the south Wales derby is that more than a century on from the first meeting of Swansea and Cardiff at the Vetch Field in 1912, neither team have done the league double.\\n\\nMiracle of Burnley: inside the Premier League’s most unlikely success story Read more\\n\\nA lot has changed since the bitter rivals last met five years ago in the Premier League, when Garry Monk took charge of his maiden game as a manager against Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who was a month into his short-lived Cardiff tenure. Wilfried Zaha and Craig Bellamy flanked Kenwyne Jones in Cardiff’s forward line, while Marvin Emnes and Wilfried Bony spearheaded Swansea’s attack, with the latter rounding off the scoring in a 3-0 win. “I wouldn’t have got out of here alive if I’d lost that game,” said Monk.\\n\\nThe teams will renew battle for the 108th time in the Championship at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday lunchtime and few understand the deep-rooted rivalry better than the former Swansea defender Ángel Rangel, who has played in the past nine meetings, including the final derby at Ninian Park in 2009, which dominated the headlines for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n“It was pretty eventful,” says Rangel, now of QPR. “Jordi [Gómez] was on the floor after winning a foul and I remember being on the same side of the pitch, where the fans were very, very hostile. The amount of coins that flew over my head was incredible. Mike Dean was the referee and he had a cut on his head from one of the coins.\\n\\n“We had to stop the game because the pitch was full of coins and, because of security reasons, after the game we actually had to stay in the changing room for about 35-45 minutes. We were not allowed to go back out until the whole stadium and the surroundings were clear.”\\n\\nFor Rangel, whose wife and three children live in Swansea, there is no shortage of derby memories, from trying to shackle Bellamy and Zaha – “I made sure I showed him what the derby was about; a couple of kicks for the first couple of balls he got” – to learning the “swim away” (a breaststroke action that Swansea have goaded their rivals with since chasing a group of Cardiff fans into the sea after a game at the Vetch in 1988) and going in goal after Michel Vorm was sent off in a 1-0 defeat at Cardiff six years ago.\\n\\n“I remember Jonjo Shelvey wanted to go in goal and I said: ‘Jonjo, you’re one of those players that can score a goal for us and we can maybe get a point. I’m a full-back, I’m not going to be able to contribute as much going forward and we’re chasing the game,’” the Spaniard says. “So, I went in goal and as soon as I go in goal, there is a free-kick outside the box for them.\\n\\n“I was like: ‘Oh no, here we go.’ It was [Peter] Whittingham at the time but luckily it went quite central and it went out for a corner. But I kept a clean sheet in that seven minutes I was in goal and the day after I went to the changing room and I had a parcel with a couple of pairs of gloves waiting for me from a goalkeeping gloves company.”\\n\\nThose matches carried extra weight for Bellamy, who was born in Cardiff, and there are a number of homegrown players in the current Swansea ranks who have grown up with the rivalry, including Joe Rodon, who was born on the outskirts of the city in Llangyfelach, and Connor Roberts, who hails from Neath. “There’s going to be an added buzz for them,” says Kristian O’Leary, the former Swansea defender and coach who grew up in Port Talbot, 10 miles east of the city. “If you’re on the right end of the result, it’s a great feeling. In those days you’d go out in town and you’d be heroes.”\\n\\nAt the first derby O’Leary was involved in, during December 1996, no away fans were allowed into Ninian Park after violence reached a tipping point. “I remember Jan Molby was in charge and he was shouting on to one of the players at the end: ‘You’re 3-1 up, instead of hanging about just get off the pitch,’” he recalls. “It was an intense affair but an enjoyable one. You wanted to be involved in those games – it’s the first fixture anyone looks at.”\\n\\nThe Liberty’s tunnel may not be as tight a squeeze as the one at the Vetch but Sunday promises to be a special occasion on a bumper day of Welsh sport. Several pubs, as well as the ground’s hospitality lounges, will screen the rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa. South Wales police say this weekend’s operation will be “less restrictive” than in previous years but 1,650 away fans will be escorted to the Liberty Stadium from a designated point near the Penllergaer service station at Junction 47 of the M4, where they will exchange travel vouchers for tickets for a sold-out game.\\n\\nFor Swansea, who have won once since August, it represents the perfect occasion to get Tuesday’s 3-0 home defeat by Brentford out of their system, while it is an opportunity for a Cardiff side that have largely flattered to deceive to lay down a marker. A clash of styles is to be expected, with the 39-year-old Swansea head coach Steve Cooper priming his team for battle against an attritional Cardiff led by Neil Warnock, who turns 71 in December.\\n\\nBen Turner, the former Cardiff defender who was on the losing side the last time the sides met, recalls items smacking the coach windows on approach to the stadium.

Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming.

The key is the private sector, which has to lead, then you can create a partnership with the public sector,” he said.\\n\\nHe said: “The problem that I’ve found is that after 35 to 40 years of trying my best with corporate, social and environmental responsibility with the private sector, and countless seminars and workshops, trying to get people to recognise the huge challenges we face, we could never actually crack the real problem, which was the lack of the real understanding on the part of the financial services and capital markets sector to understand why there was such a need to invest.”\\n\\nPrince Charles's designer town accused of putting aesthetics over safety Read more\\n\\nHe added it was now “more critical than ever” for the private sector to look for sustainable investments which direct money to the most effective sustainability projects.\\n\\n“Whether it is regeneration, reforestation, sorting out fisheries and ocean issues to make them more sustainable. Or agriculture and how to rebuild soil fertility – which is completely degraded around most of the world – because if you can get the soil fertility back again, you can capture carbon much more quickly,” he said.\\n\\nThe prince spoke to the Evening Standard in Tokyo during his visit for the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito. His visit took place less than two weeks after Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan, causing at least 80 deaths and underlining the need for governments to prepare for extreme storms, now more likely because of global heating.\", 'A magnificent and historically important castle at the centrepiece of one of the UK’s most eye-catching cultural regeneration projects will open to the public next week after a three-year restoration project.\\n\\nAuckland Castle was a palace for the prince bishops of Durham, surrogate kings who governed the north of England for more than 750 years.\\n\\nIt was bought from the Church of England in 2012 by the investment banker Jonathan Ruffer. The sale price included the castle’s contents, not least a spectacular series of paintings, Jacob and his 12 Sons, by the Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbarán.\\n\\nThe castle has become the heart of the Auckland Project, which is using art, faith, history and heritage to transform the quiet and – since the closure of the mines – rundown town of Bishop Auckland in to a leading tourist destination.\\n\\nThe castle’s restoration, with the help of £12.4m of National Lottery money, has focused on returning the castle to its Georgian gothic splendour.\\n\\nDavid Madden, chief executive of the project, said the reopening on 2 November would be a huge day. “This is a very big moment for us. It puts us on the map and there is more to come.”\\n\\nVisitors to the castle will learn about the various bishops who lived and entertained at Auckland Castle over the centuries.\\n\\nThe interior walls are more vibrantly coloured than some might imagine; lilac, pink, a cheery blue.\\n\\n“It’s not what people would expect of Georgian interiors,” said Clare Baron, head of interpretation and exhibitions. “We think of Jane Austen and pale and restrained but actually the interiors were quite gaudy. When we read a description, blue and crimson curtains with pink walls, we thought: ‘will that work?’ But it does seem to.”\\n\\nThe long dining room with the Zurbaráns was to be painted red before a crucial receipt was found indicating the room would have been green.\\n\\nThe internationally important paintings have returned to Auckland Castle after a tour to the Meadows Museum in Dallas, the Frick Collection in New York and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, where they have been seen by more than 390,000 people.\\n\\nAmong the surprises during the restoration was the discovery of a Tudor fireplace in a lift shaft and a whole wall of historic late 19th-century wallpaper in the morning room. The unusual pattern, of a brown and blue exotic plant, is entirely fictitious, botanic experts have decided.\\n\\nVisitors are also told about the more recent, less authoritarian, bishops of Durham who have lived at the castle such as David Jenkins, a regular character on Spitting Image, dismissively called the “cuckoo in the establishment nest” by Margaret Thatcher.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A restored room in Auckland Castle, with the Zurbarán masterpieces on show.

Opposite are hoardings in front of a former bank and school proclaiming “Spanish art gallery opening soon”. There will also be a faith museum, a new shop, hotel and restaurant, and in time a revamped Roman fort destination.\\n\\nBishop Auckland is also home to the Ruffer-backed Kynren, which stages thrilling London Olympics-style live shows telling Britain’s history.\\n\\nIt all makes for a compelling if unusual offer for tourists, one which does not follow any known model. “We keep looking,” said Madden. “We are a young organisation and really keen to learn from others – we are very alert to that – but there is no single thing that we’ve come across that allows us to say: ‘that’s us and they’re years ahead and this is what we should do.’”', 'System analyses body language and word choice, but polling suggests public are opposed to such use of automation\\n\\nUnilever has claimed it is saving hundreds of thousands of pounds a year by replacing human recruiters with an artificial intelligence system, amid warnings of a populist backlash against the spread of machine learning.\\n\\nThe multinational told the Guardian it had saved 100,000 hours of human recruitment time in the last year by deploying software to analyse video interviews.\\n\\nThe system scans graduate candidates’ facial expressions, body language and word choice and checks them against traits that are considered to be predictive of job success. Vodafone, Singapore Airlines and Intel are among other companies to have used similar systems.\\n\\nPolling commissioned by the Royal Society of Arts and released on Friday suggests 60% of the public are opposed to the use of automated decision-making in recruitment as well as in criminal justice.\\n\\nA citizens’ jury convened by the charity to explore AI concluded that the growing practice needed independent regulation and warned of public anger at “tech creep” unless citizens were given a greater role in designing systems.\\n\\nA parallel YouGov poll found that only 32% of people are aware AI is being used for decision-making in general. Awareness of automated decision-making in workplaces and the criminal justice system is even lower, at 14% and 9% respectively.\\n\\nLast week the United Nations special rapporteur Philip Alston said the world risked “stumbling zombie-like into a digital welfare dystopia” in which artificial intelligence and other technologies were used to target, surveil and punish the poorest people.\\n\\nThe Guardian reported on how the UK’s Department for Work and Pensions was accelerating the development of welfare robots for use in its flagship universal credit system, and how more than 100 councils were using predictive analytics and other artificial intelligence systems to aid interactions with their citizens.\\n\\n“New technologies are being adopted at a rapid pace, and regulators and the public are struggling to keep up,” said Asheem Singh, acting head of tech and society at the RSA.\\n\\n“An increasing amount of decision-making – in our public services, the job market and healthcare – is taking place via ever-more opaque processes. This is a source of anxiety for the general public. The measures we are proposing – such as a new watchdog to scrutinise decisions made by AI on behalf of the public – are crucial first steps in increasing clarity and accountability.”\\n\\nLast month in a report commissioned by the government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, the Royal United Services Institute, a security thinktank, warned of “unfair discrimination” by data analytics and algorithms in policing. Meanwhile, the high court ruled that South Wales police’s use of facial recognition software was legal, despite a claim it breached data protection and equality laws.\\n\\nThe RSA panel spent four days examining the spread of AI and automated decision-making into recruitment, healthcare and policing. Members of the panel voiced hopes that algorithms could make fairer, less-biased decisions on things such as pay rises or promotions, and that facial recognition programmes might be more objective than human police officers.\\n\\nBut they raised questions about whether automated decision systems would reinforce an organisation’s existing profile, for example as traditionally white and male, and how the public would know the technology was being used.\\n\\nThe jury was convened by the RSA in collaboration with DeepMind, a London-based AI firm owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.\\n\\nUnilever is using software from a US-company, HireVue, in the UK and abroad, having first trialled it in 2017. HireVue has previously said the software scans the language that candidates use – for example, active or passive phrases, tone of voice and speed of delivery – as well as facial expressions such as furrowed brows, smiles and eye-widening.\\n\\n“It is helping to save 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1m in recruitment costs each year for us globally,” said a Unilever spokeswoman. “It is, however, just one of many tools we use for our graduate recruitment.”\\n\\nShe said video interviews were optional and candidates were asked to allow or disallow automated decision-making being used to evaluate their video interview. They were sent information about how to prepare beforehand and could choose to speak to a “talent adviser” instead if they preferred.\\n\\nThe system is now used across Unilever’s entire graduate recruitment programme, and HireVue claims it has resulted in a more ethnically and gender-diverse workforce.\\n\\nUnilever said that at the early stage in the recruitment process when HireVue was used, it was not compulsory for candidates to give their gender or ethnicity so it was not able to provide representative data.', 'The pages of the borrowers’ register for Innerpeffray library are crowded with lines of arching inky script. It is open at the year 1870, and notes the prompt return by the schoolgirl Helen Boyd of The Lamplighter, a popular novel about an orphan’s salvation. On the opposite page, the aptly named Thomas Stalker, a local gamekeeper, took home the Lifeworks of Robert Burns.\\n\\nThis register, spanning across two centuries, offers a unique reading history of a rural Perthshire community. It is one of the many quietly astonishing artefacts to be discovered at Scotland’s first free, public lending library, which on Friday receives a funding boost that should allow it to proclaim its treasure trove for bibliophiles more widely.\\n\\nThe library was founded at Innerpeffray, a hamlet to the south of Crieff, by the local landowner David Drummond, the Third Lord Madertie, in 1680. It was a radical move that allowed workers from the nearby farmsteads and large estate houses to explore the collection, as well as clergy, students and schoolchildren. The register reflects borrowers from all strata of society: farmers, weavers, teachers, blacksmiths, scholars and ministers.\\n\\nCharging his heirs to provide for the library “for time coming”, Drummond also provided for a school to be built next to the chapel, which originally housed the library, pre-empting the 1696 Education Act, one of the final measures of Scotland’s parliament before union with England.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lara Haggerty, Innerpeffray’s library manager and keeper of books. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\\n\\nIn the early 18th century, one of Drummond’s descendants raised funds for a new building to accommodate the expanding collection, which now stands between the chapel and schoolroom. Its high south-facing windows, looking across the strath to the meandering river Earn, flood the first-floor reading room with light even on winter days.\\n\\nWhile the borrowing of such rare items is no longer feasible, visiting readers can pass an hour or two examining any of the 5,000 volumes ranging from theology and history to Enlightenment philosophy, or browsing through the first 50 years of the Scots magazine, first published in 1739 and covering events including the defeat of the Jacobites at Culloden.\\n\\nLara Haggerty, Innerpeffray’s 31st keeper of books, a title bestowed by Drummond, welcomes the funding boost of £100,000 announced on Friday as part of the UK government’s Tay Cities deal, as well as a recent grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which will make possible improvements to the school room and plans for a woodland trail around the library building.\\n\\nFor Haggerty, one of the delights of the library is the far-sighted generosity of its founder: “The joy of Innerpeffray is its variety. He left such a multi-faceted collection, and he wasn’t didactic about what people should read because he himself read medicine, travel, military history. Nor did he limit who could access the collection. He wanted anyone who can read to benefit from it.”', 'Supplies from turbines will prove to be the next great energy revolution, IEA predicts\\n\\nErecting wind turbines on the world’s best offshore sites could provide more than enough clean energy to meet global electricity demand, according to a report.\\n\\nA detailed study of the world’s coastlines has found that offshore windfarms alone could provide more electricity than the world needs – even if they are only built in windy regions in shallow waters near the shore.\\n\\nAnalysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) revealed that if windfarms were built across all useable sites which are no further than 60km (37 miles) off the coast, and where coastal waters are no deeper than 60 metres, they could generate 36,000 terawatt hours of renewable electricity a year. This would easily meeting the current global demand for electricity of 23,000 terawatt hours.\\n\\n“Offshore wind currently provides just 0.3% of global power generation, but its potential is vast,” the IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said.\\n\\nThe study predicts offshore wind generation will grow 15-fold to emerge as a $1tn (£780bn) industry in the next 20 years and will prove to be the next great energy revolution.\\n\\nThe IEA said earlier this week that global supplies of renewable electricity were growing faster than expected and could expand by 50% in the next five years, driven by a resurgence in solar energy. Offshore wind power would drive the world’s growth in clean power due to plummeting costs and new technological breakthroughs, including turbines close to the height of the Eiffel Tower and floating installations that can harness wind speeds further from the coast.\\n\\nThe next generation of floating turbines capable of operating further from the shore could generate enough energy to meet the world’s total electricity demand 11 times over in 2040, according to IEA estimates.\\n\\nThe report predicts that the EU’s offshore wind capacity will grow from almost 20 gigawatts today to nearly 130 gigawatts by 2040, and could reach 180 gigawatts with stronger climate commitments.\\n\\nIn China, the growth of offshore wind generation is likely to be even more rapid, the IEA said. Its offshore wind capacity is forecast to grow from 4 gigawatts to 110 gigawatts by 2040 or 170 gigawatts if it adopts tougher climate targets.\\n\\nBirol said offshore wind would not only contribute to generating clean electricity, but could also offer a major opportunity in the production of hydrogen, which can be used instead of fossil fuel gas for heating and in heavy industry.\\n\\nThe process of making hydrogen from water uses huge amounts of electricity but abundant, cheap offshore wind power could help produce a low-cost, zero-carbon alternative to gas.\\n\\nIn the North Sea, energy companies are already planning to use the electricity generated by giant offshore windfarms to turn seawater into hydrogen on a floating “green hydrogen” project, backed by the UK government. The clean-burning gas could be pumped back to shore to heat millions of homes by the 2030s. The UK has committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\n\\nThe overlap between the UK’s declining oil and gas industry and the burgeoning offshore wind sector could offer major economic benefits for the UK, Birol said.\\n\\n“Offshore wind provides a huge new business portfolio for major engineering firms and established oil and gas companies which have a strong offshore production experience,” he said. “Our analysis shows that 40% of the work in offshore wind construction and maintenance has synergies with oil and gas practises.”', 'The grime artist Stormzy, the Duchess of Sussex and the footballer Raheem Sterling have been named among the most influential black people in Britain.\\n\\nHowever, it was the founder of pioneering money transfer firm WorldRemit, Ismail Ahmed, who topped the Powerlist 2020, an annual list of the 100 most powerful people of African, African-Caribbean and African American heritage across Britain.\\n\\nAhmed set up the company, which is designed to help migrants send money back home to their families and friends, in 2010 using compensation from the UN for exposing alleged corruption in its remittance programme in Somalia.\\n\\nUsing a smartphone app, the service charges customers a nominal fee and cuts out agents who would formerly take a cut of the money.\\n\\nIn 1988, Ahmed left the autonomous region of Somaliland at the start of the civil war to study in London. He picked strawberries as a student to fund his education, along with several other jobs, and sent some of the money back to relatives living in a refugee camp.\\n\\nHe soon became frustrated at the inconvenience and cost of transferring money through traditional agents. “It is a real privilege and honour to win this award,” he said. “When I was growing up in Somaliland, I saw how money sent back home by migrants could transform the lives of individuals and entire communities.\\n\\n“I was determined to find a better way and I set up WorldRemit in 2010 with the mission of making it easier and faster for migrants to send money home.”\\n\\nRemittances are believed to make up a $700bn (£545bn) global market, according to the World Bank.

The committee held hearings on the impasse earlier this year.\\n\\nThe families of children and young adults with the disease, which gradually clogs the lungs, have fought a heart-rending campaign for the first drugs that target the cause of the disease rather than just improving symptoms. The drugs were approved four years ago but Vertex set a price tag of more than £100,000 per patient per year, which NHS England refused, saying it was unaffordable.\\n\\nMy daughter’s life is priceless, but the NHS must not overpay for drugs | Letters Read more\\n\\nBoth sides said details of the deal and how much NHS England would pay Vertex were commercially confidential. But Stevens’ letter made it clear that NHS England was happy with the terms. “We have only been able to finalise this negotiation because the company has now agreed confidential commercial terms that constitute good value for British taxpayers,” he said in his letter.\\n\\nThe last offer NHS England made to the company was £500m over five years for access to Orkambi and other drugs in the pipeline.\\n\\nCrucially, Vertex has agreed to submit its forthcoming drugs, believed to be more promising than Orkambi, to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which assesses the cost-effectiveness of drugs and can recommend or bar them from NHS use. Vertex had withdrawn its future drugs from the process during the long standoff.\\n\\nNice will now assess all the drugs, using data not only from the trials but also from the patients who will now get them. That will enable experts to decide how well the drugs work and what they are worth.\\n\\nDrug maker 'will make $21bn from treating cystic fibrosis' Read more\\n\\nStevens said in his letter that the deal would apply to Wales and Northern Ireland as well. However, it will not apply to Scotland, which recently made its own agreement with Vertex. Stevens implied NHS England had done better.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, we have not been able to extend this option for Scottish patients. That is because six weeks ago a decision was taken there to step away from coordinated UK-wide approach by ignoring the independent expert medical advice of the Scottish Medicines Consortium – their equivalent of Nice. We are, however, legally able to share with the Scottish government confidential details of the improved deal we have now negotiated for England,” he wrote.\\n\\nThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was wonderful news. “We’ve agreed a deal to provide Orkambi and other lifesaving cystic fibrosis drugs on the NHS. The deal is great value for money for the NHS and, crucially, will improve thousands of lives. This deal – on the back of several others this summer – shows why we get some of the best-value drugs in the world, and is another reason to be so proud of our NHS,” he said.\\n\\nLudovic Fenaux, a senior vice-president at Vertex International, said it was “a significant day for the cystic fibrosis community in England. This important agreement, reached in collaboration and partnership with NHS England and Nice, will allow more than 5,000 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in England to have access to CFTR modulators to treat the underlying cause of their disease.”\", 'A citizen army is needed to help tackle invasive species that threaten the natural environment and in some cases human health, MPs have said.\\n\\nThe cost to the economy of non-native species taking hold in the UK is estimated to be £1.8bn a year, a report from the environmental audit committee says.\\n\\nAmong their recommendations, they call for an army of 1.3 million volunteers to be trained across the country to identify and respond to the threat from non-native species, in a scheme modelled on one developed in New Zealand.\\n\\nThe report says urgent action is needed to slow the rate of arrival of invasive species and prevent them from becoming established. It estimates that about 40 non-native species will become invasive within the next 20 years.\\n\\nThe report says ministers have missed the legal targets on tackling invasive species and have failed to give the threat the same priority and funding as animal and plant health regimes.\\n\\nCurrent funding for biosecurity in Great Britain is estimated at £220m a year, while invasive species work receives less than 1% of that sum (£0.9m).\\n\\nInvasive non-native species are those that have been moved as a result of human activity. They are considered one of the top five threats to the natural environment.\\n\\nInvasive species and their effects currently in the UK include:\\n\\nAn epidemic of ash dieback caused by a non-native fungus, which is predicted to kill half of the UK’s native ash trees, at a cost of £15bn, over the next 100 years.\\n\\nSignal crayfish, which have been the main cause of the rapid decline in native crayfish through the transmission of crayfish plague.\\n\\nXylella on olive imports that can infect more than 350 different plant species and causes symptoms including leaf scorch, wilt, dieback and plant death.\\n\\nLabour’s Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee, said: “If we’re to beat this, we need people power, with an army of volunteers trained to spot and stop an invasive species before it becomes established.\\n\\n“We’re witnessing changes, from climate change, that put the future of our natural landscape at risk. Oak processionary moth caterpillars can strip an oak tree bare, as well as posing a hazard to our own health. We face losing half of the UK’s native ash trees to ash dieback within a century, costing £15bn. New regulations to halt their progress are welcome but they are too little, too late. Government funding to tackle invasive species is tiny and fails to match the scale of the threat.”\\n\\nRichard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “These invaders can choke out native species, spread disease and strangle industry. Yet the government’s defences against invasive species are decades behind animal and plant health security. It’s time to dedicate the funds and personnel needed to hold the line to defend wildlife.”\\n\\nThe UK has one of the highest numbers of invasive species in the world, MPs on the committee heard in evidence.\\n\\nA significant increase in the numbers of invasive species across the globe is attributed to a threefold increase in travel and a rise in air and sea transport of goods. The species arrive in the UK in a variety of ways, including by attaching themselves to the hulls of ships or “hitchhiking” within ballast water, as contaminants of ornamental plants, or on fishing equipment.', \"Several women heckled after raising questions about producer’s attendance at talent show\\n\\n'Freddy Krueger in the room': women confront Harvey Weinstein at New York event\\n\\nSeveral women were booed, heckled and asked to leave after confronting Harvey Weinstein at a New York showcase for emerging talent.\\n\\nComedian Kelly Bachman told the Guardian she “felt like the air was sucked out of the room” when she called out Weinstein during a set she performed at the event.\\n\\nShe embraced the silence, she said. “I was okay with the fact that there was silence.

But we were initially very surprised to see what we did.”\\n\\nThe discovery came from time spent collecting meltwater samples on Ellesmere Island, in Canada’s Nunavut territory, where several glaciers flow into Lake Hazen. The team of researchers also gathered samples in the Rocky Mountains and Greenland.\\n\\n“We have a pretty good understanding of the state of glaciers globally,” said St Pierre. “One thing we don’t know much about is the meltwaters and what happens when it … flows into rivers and downstream lakes.”\\n\\nIn temperate rivers, a bounty of organic material – plant life and fish – results in higher levels of decomposition, meaning the bodies of water emit a far greater amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than they absorb.\\n\\nBut glacial rivers, with their milky appearance and silt-laden composition, are not very hospitable to aquatic life, leading to far less organic decay – and little carbon output.\\n\\nAt the same time, the fine sediment scraped from glaciers, including silicate and carbonate, when tossed along in the rushing waters, begins the geological process known as chemical weathering.\\n\\n“As the rivers take up the particles, they start to mix within the water and within that water there are also gases, including carbon dioxide,” said St Pierre. “The mixing together creates these reactions and puts all these different particles together. That’s where we see that the net result is the sink of carbon dioxide.”\\n\\nThe research team discovered the effect of chemical weathering in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere extended as far away as 26 miles (42km) from the headwaters of the river.\\n\\nThis means that during high melt periods, glacial river water will absorb 40 times as much carbon as the Amazon rainforest.\\n\\n“On a per-metre-squared basis, these rivers can consume a phenomenal amount of carbon dioxide,” said St Pierre. But their limited size means on a gross scale, they pull in far less than the sprawling Amazon. The team plan on sampling meltwaters in the Canadian Rockies, and expect to find similar results.\\n\\nIn a rapidly changing climate, the findings provide a surprisingly optimistic message: there are often unseen or underappreciated ways in which the planet regulates carbon emissions. “It shows just how little we know about these systems,” said St Pierre.\\n\\nBut the Vancouver-based biologist cautions that the short-term benefits of the newly discovered carbon sink also illustrate the rapid decline of glaciers in northern Canada.\\n\\n“Glaciers are a finite resource. The waters that emanate from them are also a finite resource. And we’re potentially losing something that we’re deriving a lot of benefits from, before we actually fully understand it,” said St Pierre.\\n\\nPrevious research into glacial retreat found that the massive bodies of ice and rock were shrinking at a rate far faster than initially predicted by scientists.\\n\\nLake Hazen, the subject of St Pierre’s research, also makes for an interesting case study.\\n\\nIn research published last year in the journal Nature Communications, biologists discovered the lake, one of largest of the high Arctic, was changing at a dramatic rate. Since 2007, water entering the lake from melting glaciers has increased tenfold over historic flow rates. With the water comes sedimentation, the same particles responsible for removing carbon dioxide. Because of the cloudier water in the lake, researchers speculate that the char population is growing skinnier, with the fish finding it more difficult to navigate the murky waters.\\n\\nAs warming in the Canadian Arctic accelerates at a rate faster than the rest of the planet, St Pierre hopes that it isn’t too late for the public to understand the stakes for the region.\\n\\n“Within the context of climate change, we’re losing systems that are just spectacular for the people who actually get to see them,” said St Pierre. “And our hope is that people really see why this science is important.”', 'Indigenous Australians watch tourists make last climbs after years of asking for closure\\n\\nAustralian Indigenous traditional owners have watched tourists climb over their sacred rock Uluru for the final time after years of pleading for people to respect their culture and only walk around the base.\\n\\nAt 4pm on Friday, Parks Australia closed the climb permanently, 34 years after the government officially returned the site to its traditional Anangu owners.\\n\\nHundreds of Australian and international visitors had queued to scale the 348-metre high sandstone monolith, once known as Ayers Rock, on the final day.\\n\\nTjiangu Thomas, a 28-year-old Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park ranger, said it had been easy to wake up on Friday knowing the climb was closing for good.\\n\\n“This is really important for me and for Anangu and for the region,” he said. “It’s a strong example of Anangu making decisions for their land.\\n\\n“At the end of the day, respect is a choice. Obviously it’s disappointing [to see people wanting to climb] but compared to the school holidays this [crowd] isn’t too much.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tjiangu Thomas at the base of Uluru. Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian\\n\\nFor years a sign at the foot of the rock encouraged visitors to respect the wishes of traditional owners and “please don’t climb” and to instead walk the six-and-a-half mile (10.6km) track around the base.\\n\\nAboriginal people have lived in the area for at least 30,000 years. Uluru’s origins in formation go back half a billion years.\\n\\nThe first non-Aboriginal person to see the rock was the explorer William Gosse in 1873, who, after traversing “wretched country” saw “one immense rock rising abruptly from the plain”. The rock is higher than the Eiffel Tower and extends several kilometres below the ground.\\n\\nGosse named it Ayers Rock after Sir Henry Ayers, the chief secretary of South Australia at the time. In 1993 the rock was formally given its traditional name, Uluru.\\n\\nClimbing of the rock began in the 1930s, taking a spiritually significant route up the steep slope that traced the steps taken by the ancestral Mala men who arrived at Uluru. A chain link handrail was installed in 1966 without consulting traditional owners.\\n\\nThe number of visitors climbing Uluru has been steadily dropping, from about three-quarters of visitors to the site in the 1990s to just 16.5% in 2015.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The last day of climbing at Uluru. One Anangu man described the route as a scar on the rock.

At least 36 people have died during the climb, and between 2002-09 rangers rescued 74 people, many struck with heat exhaustion and dehydration.\\n\\nIn 2016, the government resisted persistent pressure to close the climb, but a year ago, a management board meeting of the national park voted unanimously to ban the practice.\\n\\nThomas said: “It’s rather emotional, having elders who picked up this long journey before I was born to close the climb. They’re no longer here, but we’re carrying their legacy to close the climb. So there’s a bit of sadness there, but also happiness knowing that the climb will be closed and respect is going to be given to Anangu’s wishes.\\n\\n“It takes a lot of our resources to manage the climb and it does take away from the cultural value of this place.”\\n\\nOn Friday, there were cheers among the tourists when rangers opened the climb after a morning closure due to high winds. Some boos also accompanied the first climbers.\\n\\nOn Wednesday and Thursday the climb had been closed intermittently as temperatures went above 36C (96.8F), the threshold for rangers to close the climb.\\n\\nAt the front of the queue a couple from the South Australian city of Adelaide, who did not want to be named, said the climb was “important to them as Australians, because the rock is a symbol for all of us”.\\n\\nHikaru Ide, from Nagano, Japan, who is on a working holiday in Australia, said he had come to Uluru to pay his respects by not climbing.

Boeing’s 737 Max planes were grounded worldwide following the crashes.\\n\\nThe MCAS should be redesigned to include a backup and all systems that can take over flight control should receive closer scrutiny during certification, according to the final report published by the investigators on Friday.\\n\\n“The investigation considered that the design and certification of this feature was inadequate,” the report said. “The aircraft flight manual and flight crew training did not include information about MCAS.”\\n\\nThe report also found that Boeing failed to detect a software error resulting in a warning light not working and failed to provide pilots with information about the flight control system.\\n\\n“The absence of guidance on MCAS […] in the flight manuals and pilot training made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS,” said a presentation shown by investigators in Jakarta on Friday.\\n\\nLion Air jet crash: cockpit voice recorder found, says Indonesian official Read more\\n\\nBoeing has already said it plans to remake the system and provide more information about it in pilot manuals. The company still expects the troubled 737 Max jet to return to service by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe final report said the first officer onboard was unfamiliar with procedures and had shown issues handling the aircraft during training.\\n\\nThe report also found that a critical sensor providing data to an anti-stall system had been miscalibrated by a repair shop in Florida and there were strong indications it had not been tested during installation by Lion Air maintenance staff.\\n\\nLion Air should have grounded the jet following similar faults on the plane’s previous flight, the report said, adding that 31 pages were missing from the airline’s October maintenance logs. Lion Air did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe Indonesian investigators also made recommendations that regulators, including the US Federal Aviation Administration and its counterpart in Indonesia, improve their oversight over certification and maintenance.\\n\\nThe report is one of multiple investigations, including those by US regulators and Congress, faced by Boeing into the crashes of what was previously its most popular plane.\\n\\nThe crisis has led Boeing to set aside $4.9bn (£3.8bn) to cover the costs of the groundings. On Wednesday, the company announced it made $20bn in revenues during the third quarter of the year, down by more than a fifth from the previous year. Profits fell by more than 50%.\\n\\nOn Friday, Boeing said it had implemented three new software fixes for the MCAS issues that would mean it was not dependent on a single sensor and that would allow a pilot to override it. Boeing has completed a certification test flight with the updates in place.\\n\\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\\n\\nDennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive officer, who had the chairmanship removed this month, said: “On behalf of everyone at Boeing, I want to convey our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in these accidents. We mourn with Lion Air, and we would like to express our deepest sympathies to the Lion Air family.”\\n\\n“We are addressing [Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s] safety recommendations, and taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max to prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again.”\\n\\nBoeing still expects to regain regulatory approval for the 737 Max “in the fourth quarter of 2019”. The company hopes to increase its rate of production of the aircraft – which it cut in the aftermath of the flight bans – from 42 per month to 57 per month by late 2020.', \"Defense secretary said the redeployment was ‘reinforcing our position’ in the country\\n\\nThe US defence secretary has confirmed “mechanised forces” will be redeployed alongside soldiers to protect oil fields in eastern Syria, in a reversal of Donald Trump’s earlier order to withdraw all troops from the country.\\n\\nMark Esper told a press conference at Nato headquarters in Brussels that “we are reinforcing our position” in Syria that “will include some mechanised forces” although he tried to insist that the US mission in the country was unchanged.\\n\\nThe goal, the secretary added, was “to deny Isis access to the oil fields” in north-east Syria, although he would not say how many US troops would remain other than to indicate the number would be fewer than 1,000.\\n\\nMinutes earlier, Donald Trump, had tweeted to explain the importance of securing the oil, as part of his agreement with Turkey, which gave the green light for the Turkish president, Racep Tayyip Erdoğan, to launch an invasion to establish a security zone last month.\\n\\nTrump declared: “When these pundit fools who have called the Middle East wrong for 20 years ask what we are getting out of the deal, I simply say, THE OIL, AND WE ARE BRINGING OUR SOLDIERS BACK HOME, ISIS SECURED!”\\n\\nEsper said the intention was “to strengthen our position at Deir ez-Zor,” most likely at a Conoco gas plant, the site of a February 2018 clash between US special forces and Syrian regime-backed militias fighting with Russian mercenaries.\\n\\nThe bulk of the 1,000 US troops who had been deployed in north-east Syria at the beginning of the month would return home, Esper indicated. “All the other forces would be turned off,” he said.\\n\\nOn Thursday night, as reports of the unexpected redeployment first circulated, Fox News reported that tanks would be used, probably from units already in the Middle East. CNN said it would happen relatively soon.\\n\\nTrump's Turkey deal hands power to Ankara and leaves Syrian Kurds for dead Read more\\n\\n“It would mean walling off eastern Syria as a US zone,” Aaron Stein, director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Washington, said of the plan to put tanks around the Conoco plant.\\n\\n“You would have to protect it from the air. You have to supply it and then you have got to protect the road, presumably from Iraq. You can easily see a scenario where we end up with more troops in Syria than we started off with.”\\n\\nTrump added to the confusion on Thursday by tweeting: “Perhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the oil region!” The remark seemed to endorse a population transfer from the Kurdish areas along the border with Turkey southwards to the almost entirely Sunni Arab area of Deir Ezzor.\\n\\nSuch a mass displacement of Kurds from their homes would fit with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s plans to resettle north-eastern Syria with Syrian Arab refugees to create a buffer zone against Kurdish insurgents. Kurdish refugees in Turkey are already reported to be subject to forcible deportation.\\n\\n“The president of the United States is now helping Turkey achieve ethnic cleansing by telling the Kurds to flee their homes,” former US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said in a comment on Twitter.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Erdoğan struck a deal with Vladimir Putin on a 30km-deep “safe zone” in which Russian military police and Syrian border guards would oversee the withdrawal of armed Kurdish units from the area.\\n\\nSuch mass demographic changes – carried out at the barrel of a gun – risk prolonging Syria’s multiple-front conflict indefinitely, said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and the UN’s former humanitarian chief.\\n\\n“This was an area of relative stability, before all of these deals,” said Egeland, who was also the UN’s special adviser on Syria. “We need to remind all of these people with the power and the guns that this is no chessboard. It is a place where people live.”\\n\\nEgeland said about 180,000 people, half of them children, had been displaced as a consequence of the Turkish incursion. He added that Kurds arriving at overcrowded camps in Iraq said that many more would join the exodus from the north-east but could not afford to pay people-smugglers who charge hundreds of dollars per person.\\n\\nEgeland said the mass displacement of populations was being brought about as a consequence of “explosive, improvised deals”.\\n\\n“For many, the move will not be voluntary and they will displacing the original population there. No problems will be solved and new problems will be created,” he said.\\n\\nThe US special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, admitted on Wednesday that “a bit more than 100 Isis detainees have escaped” from captivity as a result of the chaos triggered by the Turkish incursion. Trump claimed on the same day that the escaped Isis fighters had been “largely recaptured”. Jeffrey told Congress: “We do not know where they are.”\\n\\nThere was also considerable uncertainty on Thursday of the fate of nearly 70,000 people, almost all women and children in the al-Hawl camp in north-eastern Syria. Some of them are families of Isis fighters, but many are civilians swept up in formerly Isis-run areas.\\n\\nThe UN’s assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Ursula Mueller, said the situation in the camp was “desperate”. In a warning directed largely to western nations, Mueller said: “Member states have the primary responsibility for their own nationals, and policies and actions that lead to statelessness should be avoided.”\", \"Rome’s mayor has accused trade unions of holding the city hostage as public services grounded to a halt on Friday during to a general strike over the poor management of the Italian capital.\\n\\nHundreds of staff from 18 civic firms gathered at Piazza del Campidoglio, home to Rome’s council, to call on Virginia Raggi, who was elected mayor in June 2016, to resign. “Rome doesn’t deserve to be governed in this way,” said Alberto Civica, from the UIL labour union.\\n\\nRubbish went uncollected and bus, train and tram services were disrupted in what the Italian media called Rome’s “Black Friday”. The industrial action also affected schools, museums and social services. There were strikes nationwide, with Alitalia cancelling 240 flights, but Rome was the hardest hit.\\n\\nRaggi, Rome’s first female mayor, mocked the strikers as a “minority of trade unionists who are trying to hold hostage a city of 3 million residents”. She tweeted: “They are workers, mothers and fathers who take their children to school every day, students and commuters. Most citizens are tired of unjustified strikes.”\\n\\nBut Rome’s citizens, who are planning what has been described as a “passive march” against Raggi’s administration on Saturday, are also tired of the shoddy state of the city, from the overflowing bins, pot-holed streets and monuments scarred with graffiti, to the unkempt parks and increasingly dysfunctional transport system. More than 20 buses have caught fire since the beginning of the year due to poor maintenance.\\n\\n“Rome has got much worse in recent years,” said Daniela Lucadelli, who was born in the city. “There’s rubbish on the streets, which attracts rats and wild boar … this is the capital of Italy, as well as an open museum, it needs to have money invested in it and to be treated with respect.”\\n\\n'Rome says enough': thousands rally to denounce city's decaying state Read more\\n\\nGiorgio Robustelli, a member of the Filcams CGIL labour union, said: “I’ve come to protest the degradation of Rome … the city has more difficulties than it used to.”\\n\\nRaggi often blames the city’s ills on the decades of inefficiency and corruption that engulfed previous administrations. By the time she took office, Rome was saddled with €13bn (£11bn) of debt.\\n\\nRaggi, who was cleared by a Rome court last November of allegations of cronyism and abuse of power, has resisted calls to resign. But with rival political parties organising petitions to get her to quit before the next mayoral elections in 2021, her future is uncertain .\\n\\n“The mayor has offended people with her arrogant words,” said Bruno Astorre, the secretary of the Democratic party in the Lazio region. “Striking is an absolute right. Rome is blocked today because of Raggi’s bad governance, not because of exasperated workers.”\\n\\nSaturday’s march along the River Tiber comes a year after thousands of residents protested outside the local authority to decry the city’s scruffy condition, attracting headlines across the world. Raggi dismissed the protesters as “people from the Democratic party with designer handbags and poodles”.\", 'Tens of thousands in California were ordered to evacuate their homes on Thursday as wildfires raged in the north and south, after dry, windy weather prompted the state’s largest utility company to impose sweeping electrical blackouts.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore than 40,000 in southern California were ordered to evacuate as wildfires burned near a Los Angeles area neighborhood. Several homes burned on Thursday as two fires fanned by powerful winds swept through dry brush to the edge of communities in the Santa Clarita area. No injuries were immediately reported, but the LA fire chief said there was no containment of either blaze.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, the Kincade fire, in the Sonoma county wine region of in northern California, exploded to more than 10,000 acres (15 sq miles, or 39 sq km). Authorities ordered evacuations for nearly 2,000 people in and around Geyserville, a small town and popular destination for wine country tourists. By Thursday evening, the fire had grown to 25 sq miles, and was 5% contained.\\n\\nIn Napa county, a large smoke cloud from the Kincade fire marred a clear blue sky. Strong winds whipped through tree branches and yellowing grape vines, bringing respite from the high temperatures and relentless sun.\\n\\nWhile the cause of the fire has yet to officially be confirmed, Pacific Gas & Electric said it had a problem with a transmission tower near where the Kincade fire ignited. The company filed a report with the state utilities commission on Thursday, saying it had become aware of a transmission-level outage in the Geysers region in Sonoma county around 9.20pm on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe wildfire was reported minutes later in the same area, although it is not clear whether the malfunction sparked the blaze.\\n\\nDangerous weather conditions prompted electrical shutoffs across the state as PG&E, whose power lines have been found responsible for sparking previous deadly wildfires, and Southern California Edison sought to avoid catastrophe.

Asked about a potential military base, Russia’s first in Africa, he said that his government was “considering the possibilities”.\\n\\nThe Kremlin later denied that Putin had discussed the establishment of a Russian military base in CAR. Touadéra said the question was being reviewed by the two countries’ defence ministries.\\n\\nThe remarks came as Russia holds its first Russia-Africa summit, an estimated £55m effort to charm African leaders with the prospect of arms deals, and investments in mining, nuclear energy and other spheres, while promising no political strings attached.\\n\\nLeaked documents reveal Russian effort to exert influence in Africa Read more\\n\\nRussia believes it can extend its influence to become a geopolitical powerbroker in Africa and begin to make up ground against China’s massive investment in the region, while edging out other powers like the US and France.\\n\\nThe timing for the summit has also been fortuitous, with Putin recently brokering a deal with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey to take joint control over previously Kurdish-held territory in north-eastern Syria. The deal highlighted Russia’s role as a dealmaker in the conflict and ability to withstand western pressure, as well as the abrupt US pullout from its alliance with the Kurds under Donald Trump.\\n\\nLeaked documents revealed by the Guardian in June showed that Russia has sought to bolster its presence in at least 13 countries in Africa through military deals, private business contracts, and by grooming a new generation of leaders. That mission to spread Russian influence was led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman close to Putin whose interests include a private military group that has deployed to Ukraine, Syria and CAR.\\n\\nBut while Prigozhin’s efforts to spread influence have largely remained in the shadows, Russia this week has sought to shine a spotlight on its growing relationship with Africa.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Putin rolled out the red carpet in Sochi, holding marathon bilateral sessions with African leaders to say Russia was open for business. “We currently export to Africa $25bn [£19.5bn] worth of food – which is more than we export in arms, at $15bn,” he said. “In the next four to five years, I think we should be able to double this trade, at least.” As the conference began, Russia flew two Tupolev Tu-160 nuclear bombers to South Africa, the first time the planes have landed on the continent.\\n\\nRussian trade with Africa is about 10% of China’s, which exceeded $200bn last year, but Moscow has traditionally dominated certain sectors like weapons exports. Agriculture, mining and civilian nuclear power were also a focus during the summit. Overall, Russia said $12bn in deals had been struck at the conference, although many were in memorandums of understanding that may not be fulfilled.', 'Disputed victory will likely stoke tensions after days of angry clashes and allegations of vote tampering made by opposition\\n\\nEvo Morales has narrowly won a controversial fourth presidential term just as tens of thousands of Bolivians marched in the administrative capital, La Paz, and cities across the country on the fourth day of protests decrying alleged voter fraud.\\n\\nWith 99.99% of the official vote counted, Morales won 47.07%, fractionally clearing the 10-point margin he needed to avoid a second-round run-off against the main opposition candidate, Carlos Mesa, who won 36.51% of the vote.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Bolivia’s electoral board said 0.01% votes have been voided in the region of Beni with new voting there scheduled for November.

Now, 30 of his songs are getting a second life from Shakespeare\\n\\nEven in a completely empty theatre, Max Martin manages to disappear, choosing to perch himself on the back row, almost completely hidden in shadow. If you didn’t know whom you were looking for, you would assume the long-haired, 48-year-old Swede, dressed in a black T-shirt, was taking a break from shifting props for that night’s performance of the new jukebox musical & Juliet.\\n\\nIt seems inconceivable that someone so unassuming could have dominated pop music for more than 20 years, but the statistics speak for themselves. Martin has co-written and co-produced 73 US Top 10 singles for the likes of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Britney Spears. Twenty-two went to No 1, with 12 also topping the UK charts. Collectively, these have sold more than 150m copies globally, earning Martin an Oscar nomination, five Grammys and the 2016 Polar Music prize (previously won by Bob Dylan and Patti Smith). Martin’s 22 US No 1s make him the third-most successful songwriter in US chart history, behind only Paul McCartney (32) and John Lennon (26).\\n\\nHe is the man who introduced the imperishable, if occasionally linguistically questionable, choruses “Hit me baby one more time”, “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and “Backstreet’s back, all right!” to karaoke booths everywhere, with songs that were at once dramatic, melancholic and never less than relentlessly catchy. The hugely ambitious & Juliet – a modern re-telling of Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet in which Juliet decides not to kill herself , but to head to Paris in order to live a little – is woven expertly around 30 of these hits, originally written for artists ranging from Celine Dion to ‘NSync, the Weeknd to Pink.\\n\\nMartin hardly ever gives interviews. “I’m not a shy person,” he clarifies as we sit in one of Manchester Opera House’s tiny bars, his accent a mix of Swedish and the Los Angeles drawl of his adopted home. “I just like to stay in the background as much as possible.”\\n\\nWhen I heard Britney singing I just knew instantly. The way she recorded that song, she added another dimension Max Martin\\n\\nEver since he earned his first US Top 10 hit in 1997 by co-writing and co-producing fellow Swede Robyn’s Do You Know (What It Takes), Martin has been a self-confessed “studio nerd tucked away in a basement somewhere”. One rock star due to get the Max treatment assumed the quiet man he had met was an engineer and asked him when Martin was due to arrive.\\n\\nWe are joined by the writer of & Juliet’s book, David West Read, who, much to Martin’s delight, has shown up in a vintage Britney T-shirt. “You’re about to find out I love talking,” Martin continues, popping a snus (a moist tobacco bag, popular in Sweden) under his top lip. “We’ve been putting a lot of work into & Juliet and it’s a new field for me, so I don’t mind talking about this.”\\n\\nMartin had been toying with the idea of a jukebox musical for years, inspired by Abba’s global behemoth, Mamma Mia! If a feminist retelling of a Shakespeare soundtracked by Spears sounds like the work of someone who has just had a bump to the head, well, that is because it is. “I had hit my head on a kitchen cabinet and couldn’t look at screens or light for a while,” West Read says (he was concussed). “So I made a playlist of Max’s catalogue and realised that so many of the songs are about young love … of course Romeo & Juliet came to mind.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bard times … the cast of Max Martin’s new musical & Juliet. Photograph: Michael Wharley\\n\\nAs well as getting involved in the auditions and workshops, Martin also recorded the cast album. “I couldn’t be like: ‘Oh, just do it,’” he says. “A lot of the songs were written with the artists and co-writers, and so I feel responsible for all these people that have been involved throughout my career.” It also represented something that has perhaps been missing from his, as he calls it, “day job”: risk. If you have done it all, your songs turning Swift, Perry and Grande into superstars, where do you go next? “There was so much for me to learn here,” he smiles. “It’s easy to go on autopilot. If I’m feeling uncomfortable then that’s probably where I should be, rather than in a place where I’m like: ‘I totally got this.’”\\n\\nThe foundations for Martin’s empire were laid during an apprenticeship with Denniz PoP, whose 90s productions for Ace of Base had become international hits. Martin (born Karl Martin Sandberg in Stockholm) had played the French horn at school; when he met PoP (born Dag Krister Volle) he was the frontman of It’s Alive, a Kiss-inspired glam rock band. Discerning that Sandberg had an ear for pop music, PoP – a fan of pseudonyms – rechristened him Max Martin and employed him as a songwriter and producer at his Stockholm powerhouse, Cheiron studios. Cheiron’s records would fuse R&B grooves with happy/sad Abba-esque melodies. The former glam rocker Martin brought an edge of bombast and some weapons-grade melodies, soon employed on records for the Backstreet Boys and the British boyband Five.\\n\\nPoP died of cancer in August 1998, two months before the release of what may be Martin’s most famous creation. ... Baby One More Time, which he wrote singlehandedly, got to No 1 in just about every country it was released. But it almost came to nothing. The demo, Martin remembers, sat lying around for “maybe six months, a year” and attempts were made to pitch it to “really established artists”. Eventually the Backstreet Boys’ label, Jive, offered it to their new signing, Spears. “When I heard her singing, I just knew instantly,” he says. “The way she recorded that song, she added another dimension.”\\n\\nAmong the artists who turned it down were TLC, assuming that the line “Hit me baby one more time” advocated domestic violence. Martin and his fellow Swedes at Cheiron had meant it simply as slang for “call me”. Other Martin lyrics of the era also presented problems for West Read when he was weaving them into & Juliet. “It’s really kind of confusing,” he says of the Backstreet Boys’ I Want it That Way, a song that seems to undermine itself at every turn.\\n\\n“You know that’s a thing, right?” Martin beams proudly. “Like: ‘What does it mean?’ There were forums of people discussing it.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One more time … Max Martin and Britney Spears in 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage\\n\\nWhile the grammatical error that appears in Ariana Grande’s 2014 EDM stomper Break Free (“Now that I’ve become who I really are”) may have been placed there on purpose – including a “juicy line” that sticks in the listener’s memory is a very Max Martin move – the Backstreet Boys song is a clearer example of Martin’s obsession with words serving the melody, a concept he calls “melodic math”.\\n\\n“Growing up, I listened to songs by Abba, Elton John, the Beatles, and I had no idea what they meant, so to me phonetics have always been important,” he explains. “I felt something hearing this music, and it meant something to me. If you can have a great lyric that also phonetically sounds amazing, then you’re golden. But it’s also kind of cool if you write a song and people are emotionally moved without understanding what’s being said. That, to me, is as powerful.”\\n\\nHe favours simplicity, repetition and instant familiarity over unnecessary complexity, but balks at the idea that his songwriting is governed by strict rules. “It’s about having tools for when you’re stuck,” he says, leaning in as if divulging a secret. “If you have a verse that’s super-busy, and you want to take it to the next part, you might want something that has a little more space, so [the listener] can take in the information and not get lost.”\\n\\nYou can hear this technique on Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off, for example. “That’s a mathematical way of thinking, it’s not about doing it by feel,” he concedes. “But if it’s flowing, you don’t need any of that stuff.” He thinks for a moment. “Also, if there was a hard rule then all of my songs would be huge and, trust me, they’re not.”\\n\\nI’ve seen it many many times, what fame does. We’re not made to be that famous, it’s not normal Max Martin\\n\\nMartin’s early hit rate largely depended on Spears. A handful of their collaborations forms the backbone of & Juliet, tracing a narrative arc that runs from ... Baby One More Time’s “my loneliness is killing me” to Stronger’s assertive declaration of the opposite (“My loneliness ain’t killing me no more”). Did you allow yourself a little high five in the studio when you linked those two songs? “Er … maybe,” he laughs, self-effacing as ever.\\n\\nHe is keen, too, to give the artists he has worked with credit, even when, as he puts it delicately, “someone isn’t a songwriter per se”. Britney Spears, for instance. “She’s a genius,” he says, popping a fresh snus. “So much had happened to her in that [early period] and she had to grow up quickly. We had conversations with her about what she wanted to do and what she wanted to say.”\\n\\nNonetheless, the world of pop songwriting and production is still dominated by men, easily characterised as ruthless svengalis. “I don’t want to think I’m one of them,” Martin says carefully. “We try and do our best to make [the studio environment] diverse, welcoming and inclusive. Let’s try and inform and be role models as much as possible in our world and hopefully it will spread.”\\n\\nJohn Seabrook on The Song Machine: 'There's a dark side to pop' Read more\\n\\nWould he like to see more female producers? “Women aren’t encouraged in the right way,” he says. “We’re still programmed to think: ‘The boys take care of the computers’ and that has to change, and it is changing. Even if you come from a very dark place of,” – he slips into a convincing American accent – “‘I want to make a lot of money.’ It’s a stupid decision. We’re missing out on 50% of the talent.”\\n\\nA lot of Martin’s biggest hits have been with female artists: not just Spears, Swift and Perry but also British stars such as Adele, Ellie Goulding and Jessie J. He has seen at close proximity what can happen when unimaginable fame takes hold, not least Spears’s distressing, and hugely publicised, breakdown in 2007. “I think we all should be grateful [to the artists],” he says, growing animated for the first time. “It’s easy for us to say that they become these rich, spoilt divas – and I’m not talking about Britney specifically, just in general – but we forget that these artists go out into the world and work and tour and become super-famous for our enjoyment. And then we watch their lives fall apart in front of our eyes for doing something amazing.”\\n\\nHe sighs. “I’m so thankful that someone actually still wants that job. I’ve seen it many many times, what fame does. And it goes back to why I don’t do interviews. Especially now with social media: our lives are on display all the time and when you’re famous it’s on a whole other level. We’re not made to be that famous, it’s not normal. It’s not in our DNA.”\\n\\nHis more recent work with the likes of Normani and Grande have seen him embrace the fact that pop’s pendulum has swung away from pop and towards R&B and hip-hop, a shift that – when it happened in the early 00s with the rise of Pharrell Williams’s songwriting and production outfit the Neptunes – briefly knocked Martin off course. Does he have similar concerns this time?\\n\\n“I’ve come to a point where I try not to think about the perception of the work,” he says. “The first time it happened, when the boyband era crashed in front of my eyes, I was freaking out a bit, but I’ve never really been worried.” That LA breeziness returns. “I’m not [making music] because I want to be successful; I would be doing this anyway. Also, popular culture is supposed to move.” Making records, he says, is “about staying inspired, but also sticking to your guns of what you love doing”.\\n\\nSuddenly, the musical’s in-house band starts up next door, a sign that Martin is free to stop doing something he is still learning to love. As we get up to leave, we are joined by a PR who needs to speak to Martin about that evening’s opening press night. One-sided discussions are had about red carpets, photographers and local press, with Martin looking increasingly nervous. “I can still arrive via the side door right?” he says, edging back into the shadows.\\n\\n& Juliet transfers to the Shaftesbury Theatre, London on 2 November.

But Nanette is why we’re all here. A fierce exposé of the trauma and abuse (homophobic, sexist) she’d sublimated in her standup, that tense anti-comedy became a totem of the #MeToo movement and made her a global celebrity. It’s also guaranteed her biggest ever audience for this follow-up, Douglas, which toured the US and now arrives in the UK. But “if Nanette brought you here,” asks Gadsby, “what the fuck do you want out of tonight?”\\n\\nIn a real coup, she begins the show by telling us what we’re going to get. Post-support act but pre-interval, Gadsby offers up an itinerary of the set she’s about to deliver. There will be an anecdote about walking her dog, an awkward sex story, and some “gentle, good-natured needling of the patriarchy”. She’ll indulge in a little “hate-baiting”, winding up the trolls who branded Nanette a “lecture”. And there’ll be a big reveal, about Gadsby’s recently diagnosed autism – which we’ll have to pretend she hasn’t just told us about.\\n\\nHannah Gadsby: ‘Quit comedy? I can’t – I’ve got no other skillset!’ Read more\\n\\nIt’s a superlative opening, predicting not just when we’ll laugh but how, and inverting the usual structure that places big callback laughs at the end of the show. It’s got chutzpah in spades, as Gadsby revels in (and sends up) the confidence accrued from Nanette’s success. And – as an example of organising, sequencing and avoiding surprises – it tees up the show’s theme, which is Gadbsy’s out-and-proud neurodiversity.\\n\\nThe show lives up to the preamble. It finds Gadsby having more fun than she did in its predecessor, without stinting on Nanette’s key qualities of angry anti-sexism and fierce assertiveness of her right to be herself. Even ardent Nanette-bashers would have to acknowledge Gadsby’s skill in combining laugh-heavy standup with trenchant argument, as her goofy story about oversharing on a dog walk shines a light on men’s zeal for claiming and naming things. The pill? “Balls” for testicles? The so-called Pouch of Douglas, a cavity between the rectum and the uterus? Gadsby is indignant – and funny – about all of them.\\n\\nThe subject of her autism is introduced via an anecdote about school-age Gadsby missing the point – by a wide margin – in a lesson on prepositions. Finally, the show proposes her autism as an answer to what Gadsby’s comedy is – neither lecture nor monologue, but an autistic woman’s way of sharing her idiosyncratic perspective. This is demonstrated via an irreverent art history tour, singling out (usually chauvinist) details in Renaissance painting. Elsewhere, there’s less idiosyncratic material, in a middle section where Gadsby proves “I don’t need hormones to be unreasonable” by grouching about Where’s Wally? and men who golf. An attack on anti-vaxxers, however justifiable, is distinguished more by heat than light.\\n\\nBut Douglas remains a rich and entertaining show from Gadsby, one that achieves the impressive feat of both living up to Nanette and moving on from it.', 'This might sound like a reach – or, at the very least, the foolish ramblings of a man long past the point of no return – but does anyone else get the feeling that Take Me Out is going to fix everything? The ITV dating show is back this weekend after an abnormally long absence. In fact, it has been suggested that this new series was filmed more than a year ago and ITV has just been irresponsibly sitting on it. Who knows why. Maybe his new Top Gear obligations made Paddy McGuinness less of a poster boy for romance? Maybe ITV wanted to give prominence to other big-hitting Saturday night blockbusters like, oh, The Chase? No, that can’t be it. Maybe ITV just hates us? That’s the most logical explanation.\\n\\nEither way, rejoice. For Take Me Out returns just in time to save the world. Everything else might be on fire. The country might have slid into the toilet in the eyes of the wider world. Brexit may have torn your family limb from limb. But in Take Me Out, at least, we have a semblance of stability.\\n\\nNothing ever changes on this show. It is still noisy and boisterous. It still occupies the same mental spot between ‘Oh God, this clothes shop is too young for me’ and ‘Oh God, there’s a hen party on this train’. McGuinness is still everyone’s best friend. The dates are still excruciating. The catchphrases are still naff. Take Me Out remains the television equivalent of detaching your brain and dropping it into a hot tub for an hour. It is broadly, shamelessly entertaining and quite frankly, we all need it very badly.\\n\\nFor me, Take Me Out is a throwback to the more innocent days of 2010, when people weren’t forced towards the musty psychodrama of BBC Parliament for kicks. Those were the days before everyone began tweeting furious missives at Question Time until their blood pressure skyrocketed out of control and their neck exploded. Back then we knew what real entertainment was. It was watching a man called Damion systematically alienate an entire nation in the most excruciating manner imaginable.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A semblance of stability ...

It is a simple show, but one that matters so much to all of the contestants. All the different contestants. The swaggering, flexing bend–down–and–wink lads that remind you of everyone who bullied you at school. The too–eager–to–please miscasts who make your heart soar just by getting to the end intact. The creepy older guys. The obvious millionaires who send the women into fits of lust. The girls who know that the best way to be picked is to heavily allude to oral sex. They all want to win Take Me Out very very badly.\\n\\nAnd that’s what I enjoy. We are all struggling through an age of equally opposed and deeply entrenched ideologies that has left the country in a permanent state of stalemate. But watch Take Me Out. There is none of that here, because there is nothing on Earth as single–minded as the horny youth. If they want something, they will stop at nothing to get it. If they don’t want something, they will let you know immediately. No likey, no lighty. It is as simple as that. If the country was being run by Lois from the 2012 series – who stuck to her guns and wouldn’t budge until she landed herself a date with Joe Swash – then everything would have been sorted out long ago. There are many reasons to watch Take Me Out on Saturday, but that is mine. I guess it would just be nice to see people make effective decisions again.', 'There’s a painting in Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar’s new exhibition, Extremis, that neatly summarises everything intriguing about this emerging Franco-Iranian artist. At first glance, Marching Band seems to depict two lines of fiery figures, disappearing from the cyan-magenta light of the left of the canvas into a dark red void on the upper right. The combination of bright, blended colours and layering of paint is uplifting: a piece you’d hang in a living room to give it light and life. But the marching figures – to where exactly? Heaven? Death? Purgatory? – impart another meaning entirely. To those who know that the Paris-born artist spent his formative years in Tehran, and was born during the traumatic days of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, when young boys were used as human minesweepers, it could conjure a nightmare.\\n\\nThis paradox is at the heart of Extremis, which is showing at the Setareh gallery in Düsseldorf, one of Europe’s leading specialists in contemporary Iranian art. Another work, Immortal Tulip Garden, is a mesmerising depiction of semi-impressionist tulips of deep red, yellow and black, half lost in an abstract haze of blue and white. But, again, everything is not as it seems. “One evening at home in Tehran during the war, we found our garden burning up in flames due to a piece of a bombshell that fell on our land,” says Behnam-Bakhtiar, when we meet during the hanging of his show. “In the midst of all the fire, I saw our garden, dancing with the flames. It took me back to to the wild mountain tulip fields above Tehran, full of life, energy and colour. I watched the colourful tulips moving with the winds as if they were engaged in a brutal dance with the flames. Once the fire was put out, those tulips were still standing, showing their significance and strength.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Like being inside the heart of a vast flower or an exploding star ... Bloody Full Bloom.\\n\\nClean-cut, trim and casually dressed, Behnam-Bakhtiar is equally at home speaking French, English or Farsi, and has an old-world politesse that belies his relative youth. (He is 35.) You could say he is the embodiment of the joy and horror that is infused in his works. He now lives and works in St Jean Cap Ferrat, super-prime real estate on the Côte d’Azur in the south of France. It’s a paintbrush flick from Monaco, the rocky promontory of which is visible from the window of his studio. He says his income now comes entirely from selling his art, although he did previously run interior design businesses to help him fund his passion.\\n\\nYet the works in Extremis tell the story of another life. Bloody Full Bloom, a searing canvas of reds and yellows, is like being inside the heart of a vast flower or an exploding star. It was inspired by his imprisonment and torture in Iran as a hot-headed young man. He was “in and out” of one of the country’s most notorious prisons for weeks at a time, and when he eventually left Iran to live in the UAE, he again found himself in trouble with the authorities. He was imprisoned for four months there, including a month in solitary confinement. How can such harrowing experiences lead to such uplifting works?\\n\\n“One day,” he says, “when I found myself at the bottom of the pit, having been alone for four weeks in a one by two metre windowless block in freezing temperatures, I started looking within and commenced a conversation with myself. I used the silence to strengthen my other attributes as a living human being. I focused the energy flowing throughout my body and, after days had passed, I started to feel different – more balanced and less worried. The anxieties were starting to disappear.\\n\\n“I continued to increase my vibration to a point where I could feel my physical body feeling different. The rush of energy in my body would give me these warm sensations. I felt my skin heat up, as if a light was trying to manifest itself from within, a comforting sense of belonging to something greater at play. I used this energy to become stronger, to become more complete, even though I had no idea what would happen to me.”\\n\\nHe believes his dismal position led him to understand how people are more powerful than they think. “Anyone can manifest his or her energy to progress as a human being,” he says. “That is why you see something so vibrant and positive coming out and taking over a darker background in my works. I want to give to my audience the experience of finding positivity in a dire state. Why choose to remain in the suffering when you can transform it into something powerful and become a better version of yourself?”\\n\\nThese days it is a connection with nature – the sun, sea and mountains in the south of France – that inspire him.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Behnam-Bakhtiar’s new exhibition, Extremis, is at the Setareh gallery in Düsseldorf. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images for Sassan Behnam-Bakhtiar\\n\\nBut he has faced criticism from his peers for living in a wealthy part of the country. Is it harder for an artist who is not impoverished to be taken seriously? “There is always this thought of an artist having had to endure hardship in life,” he says. “At the end of the day, many artists endure hardships in so many different ways. Some decide to speak about it, some don’t. It matters to some, it doesn’t matter to others. From experience, I have learned that, as an artist, you should do what you believe in, no matter what you’re told.”\\n\\nBehnam-Bakhtiar is articulate, calm and self-possessed, answering without hesitation, as if he always knows what the next question will be. The only question he declines to answer is about exactly why he was jailed in Iran and how many times he was in trouble with the police, politely pointing out that he still has family there and, although these events were decades ago, he needs to be discreet. His family was prominent before the revolution that ushered in the Islamic Republic in 1979: his great-uncle, Shapour Bakhtiar, was the “Kerensky of Iran”, a liberal, secular politician who had spent his life opposing the regime of the corrupt Shah. Bakhtiar was eventually assassinated by the Islamic Republic while in exile in Paris.\\n\\nBehnam-Bakhtiar thinks his work is rooted in both French and Iranian culture. His previous exhibition, Oneness Wholeness, at London’s Saatchi gallery in 2018, was infused with the colour and spirit of the French Mediterranean coast. Extremis is both darker and deeper, with more figurative elements than his previously style of abstract impressionism. What remains is the artist’s technique, in which he scrapes layers of paint hundreds of times over each spot of the canvas, giving a dreamlike quality to the colours and shapes, which seem to appear and reappear.\\n\\nWhile we talk, the gallery receives a visit from a well-known Italian collector, a big name in the luxury industry, who is here for a sneak preview. He hopes to add to his collection of the artist’s works “while prices are still low” – the average cost of a work from Extremis is around €20,000 (£17,300). While it’s impossible to predict whether Behnam-Bakhtiar’s works will match the collectability of contemporary Iranian artists such as Shirin Neshat, Parviz Tanavoli and Reza Derakhshani (the latter also represented by Setareh), what’s certain is there is nobody else creating works like him.', 'Twenty-five years ago, documentary-maker Steve James had a sensational success with his engrossing and moving film Hoop Dreams, now on rerelease in the UK. It was his epic three-hour study of two African American boys from tough neighbourhoods in Chicago: Arthur Agee and William Gates, whose heartbreakingly open, intelligent, trusting and hopeful faces beamed out from the screen. James boiled down 250 hours of footage shot over five years, showing them growing up from 14 to 19 years old; both basketball-mad, both hoping for basketball scholarships to college and to a dimly perceived better life after that, maybe even being actual super-rich-and-famous basketball stars in the NBA.\\n\\nHoop Dreams received the kind of passionate response that Michael Apted had got for his Seven Up! documentary TV series or that Richard Linklater would later get for his real time coming-of-age epic Boyhood. It was famously championed by the legendary film writer Roger Ebert, who argued fiercely for it to get an Oscar nomination (Steve James repaid the compliment with his own celebratory documentary about Ebert, Life Itself, in 2014) and Hoop Dreams struck a chord in the early years of the hopeful Clinton 1990s. It is candid enough about poverty, crime, drugs, fractured families and about racial tension, especially when Agee and Gates get a scholarship to the prestigious and predominately white St Joseph High School in Illinois, famed for its basketball and for its star alumnus, Isaiah Thomas. There is also a jaw-dropping look at a “basketball house” at a junior college: a very grim accommodation block reserved for basketball scholars (that is, black students) – a highly unfortunate, ghettoised institution.\\n\\nBut the film is not about racism as such; it is not angry and racist cops do not play a part, and there isn’t a rap soundtrack. Hoop Dreams was realistic but it certainly did not rule out the possibility of these boys simply and uncontentiously making a success of their lives through the classic route of college education — and of course sports are a huge part of that. It is that hope which unlocked people’s hearts in 1994 and will do so again I think in 2019, despite the fact that Googling these boys’ names for their situation now reveals something darker and more complicated.\\n\\nQuite early on in the filming process, James must have realised that he had a great story on his hands: Gates and Agee got scholarships to the same posh school. But Agee’s schoolroom grades weren’t good enough – and he had to quit. But as his own family darkly hint: if he was doing better on the basketball court, then the school would have found a way not to worry about his fees. So poor Arthur has to go to a much rougher and more down-at-heel school, with his confidence having taken an almighty bash.\\n\\nBut wouldn’t you just know it: Arthur’s basketball prowess in this underdog school in an underdog team starts surging back up. Meanwhile, back at St Joe’s, things are difficult for William. Some things look different now. The TV show with cigar-smoking white sports reporters making their judgments on which kids are going to be big stars looked funny in 1994. Now there is something a bit seedy about it. Could Steve James make Hoop Dreams now, in the age of #blacklivesmatter when the idea of “dreams” looks more naive than any time since the 1970s? Perhaps a white film-maker would be self-conscious of doing anything of the sort. But perhaps James’s biggest achievement is his unshowy emphasis on the poetry of basketball itself: the jump shot, the slam-dunk, ecstatic physical expressions of pure transcendental success.', 'The standup, Mock the Week panellist, and Absolute Radio newsreader on the things that make him laugh the most\\n\\nThe funniest standup I’ve ever seen …\\n\\nHans Teeuwen on my first visit to the [Edinburgh] fringe as a punter in 2010.

It has a river and loads of museums and parks. It is fun to travel there by train. I’d like to be a train driver when I grow up, or maybe a pilot. Last time, we shared our seats with another family and I got to watch Paw Patrol on another boy’s iPad. So I made a new friend, which was awesome. Do you want to know what I like to do in Cambridge?\\n\\nBig cactuses and rock gardens\\n\\nExploring Cambridge University Botanic Garden\\n\\nCambridge University Botanic Garden is very near the station and is great to run around. It has a fountain, a mini-maze and stepping stones over a little lake. I think that the tall yellow grass plants look like fur. I like to hide behind the trees. You can’t climb them as it might hurt the branches. I like to make up games in the rock garden instead. The greenhouse is not green but it is hot and made of glass. Go to see the big cactuses and pretend you are a cowboy. They have very prickly spines so watch out. Also, there is a lily pad big enough for a frog the size of me.\\n\\nLong boats and flying bats\\n\\nThe Mathematical Bridge\\n\\nFrom here you can walk into town by following the river. You go over lots of bridges. If you want you can play in the Lammas Land playground. In summer, there are brown cows in Coe Fen and Midsummer Common. Real cows, you say, in the middle of Cambridge? Yes there are, and it’s kind of cool.\\n\\nAt the Mill Pond, by the Mathematical Bridge, there are lots of people on small boats called punts. An adult has to stand up with a long pole. It looks like they are fishing but really they are pushing the boats along. We went on a punt and ate strawberries. The man who pushed us was really good at ducking down under the bridges and not falling off. You can even go at night on a Bat Punt Safari. Spooky!\\n\\nDo you like skateparks, tennis or playgrounds? Jesus Green has them all, right next to the river. Sometimes we go to the family runs on Sunday morning in Milton Country Park. I can run really fast. The Science Centre has a cool marble run, and the Centre for Computing History has a lot of retro games that my dad knows all about.\\n\\nCastles and a clock that doesn’t tell the time\\n\\nTrinity College\\n\\nThere are lots of buildings that look like castles in the middle of Cambridge. King’s College looks like a church castle and Trinity College is where a man called Newton went. He had an apple fall on his head, and then he invented gravity, which is very cool. Did you know that there is a banana tree in Cambridge? It’s in Pembroke College. See if you can find the big Corpus Clock made of real gold. I think it is funny as it doesn’t even tell the time. It has a mechanical insect on the top, and if you wait for ages, his eye blinks. If you like climbing high you can see the whole of Cambridge from Great St Mary’s Church Steeple. Just don’t get stuck next to the bell when it rings! It can be fun to to explore the small streets in the centre, you could even do a treasure trail. If I get tired of walking, we go into Heffers, Waterstones or the Central Library and look at children’s books.\\n\\nThe biggest whale bones I ever saw\\n\\nArt at the Fitzwilliam, and whale bones at the Museum of Zoology\\n\\nConker contests and pumpkin picking: autumn in the UK – in pictures Read more\\n\\nDid I say that there were loads of museums? Just on Downing Street there are three, like the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Find the bronze statue of Mr Sedgwick. He is holding a hammer and a trilobite shell that is 500m years old, which is older than my mum. My favourite is the huge fin whale at the Museum of Zoology. It hangs on the ceiling and it’s ginormous. You can look up and see all its bones and teeth. I also like the stuffed animals, games, and big screen with tiny square TVs of different creatures. My brother says we have to look after animals or they just get extinct. There is a museum that also looks like a castle. It is the Fitzwilliam and when you get in the ceiling is really high. You have got to see the Egyptian mummies, the knight’s armour and the swords – they are awesome. If you like real animals, then the red pandas in Shepreth Wildlife Park are really cute. It is right next to Shepreth train station, just a few minutes outside Cambridge.\\n\\nHungry by now?\\n\\nChelsea Buns at Fitzbillies\\n\\nAromi has tasty Sicilian margherita pizza that you eat from a wooden plate. I love the dark chocolate ice-cream. My brother likes Bill’s restaurant, as he says it has delicious buttermilk pancakes with bacon and the staff are really friendly. They are only served at brunch so you must be early. He also likes the spicy chicken rolls in Pho (Vietnamese). La Margherita has nice pasta, and is near Kettles Yard Art Gallery. The MillWorks has a real gigantic wheel in the middle and is right next to the river. My favourite is a plain burger and fries at Byron Burger or Honest Burger, but it has to have ketchup. If you want some treats for the train home, there are Chelsea buns in Fitzbillies. On Mill Road, near the station, you can get nice cakes in the Urban Larder or Norfolk Street Bakery. And if you want an apple to fall on your head and have a big idea, you can go to the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester for strawberry jam scones and sit under the trees in a deckchair.\\n\\nTake a trip to Cambridge.

One might be checking work emails, another playing a video game, watching YouTube or scrolling through Instagram – but nobody is talking.\\n\\nIf you relate to this scenario, you’re not alone. According to a recent YouGov survey of 3,051 British parents commissioned for ITV’s new mental wellbeing campaign, Britain Get Talking, a quarter of parents of teens agree they are often in the same room as their children, but not talking.\\n\\nResearchers call it “alone together time” – when we’re all occupying the same physical space but not necessarily the same mental one. “We never talk any more” is a common complaint, and there’s no doubt that the way we interact with each other has changed in many ways over the past decade, but could it have a harmful effect on our mental health?\\n\\nThe number of people struggling with mental health issues is on the rise. One in four adults experience mental illness each year, while the prevalence of children aged five to 15 experiencing emotional disorders (including anxiety and depression) has gone up by 48% since 2004. Charity YoungMinds says approximately three children in every classroom could have a mental health disorder.\\n\\nWhile there are many contributing factors to this rise, experts believe increasing our day-to-day interactions with loved ones can help. “Spending quality time with the people around you is so important,” says Stephen Buckley from the charity Mind. “Taking the time to have a conversation about something that interests you both, or checking how you’re doing is essential for your wellbeing.”\\n\\nResearch bears this out, especially with children. A recent NHS study found that family and friends were the most common source of informal support for children coping with mental illness (44.6%), and a significant majority (84%) described this as helpful.\\n\\nKindness, belonging and conversation: how to help kids open up about their feelings Read more\\n\\nThe power of talking is clear to Michael Player, psychologist and co-author of StressLess. “When we don’t share our problems those thoughts go round and round in our heads,” he says. “We expand them and catastrophise them. But talking to someone forces you to put these thoughts into coherent sentences, which uses the rational part of your brain. That’s why we often feel so much better afterwards, because the rational brain helps you get things back in proportion. It’s often not about what the other person says – all they have to do is listen to you talk.”\\n\\nIn light of this, ITV and STV have linked up with both Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH to create Britain Get Talking, designed to encourage us to communicate face-to-face with those closest to us, or pick up the phone to get in touch with them. Proving how seriously it’s taking the project, the network launched the campaign during the Saturday 5 October episode of Britain’s Got Talent, with Ant and Dec halting proceedings for a short time to encourage viewers at home to start their own conversations and really connect with those around them.\\n\\nAccording to ITV’s research, this prime time prompt was much needed. Although 85% of parents polled agreed that having a proper chat with their children can improve mental health, one in 10 said they spend less than 15 minutes a day having a meaningful chat with their teens.\\n\\nFor time-poor parents, the good news is, according to Player, you don’t have to go deep to make a difference – those everyday, casual “did you catch last night’s Corrie?” type chats can have a real, positive impact. “Talking about something trivial can keep the lines of communication open. It’s really about creating a safe space, making that person feel comfortable enough to take the conversation wherever they want it to go. Once they get to that place, they might feel able to open up about what’s really bothering them.”\\n\\nITV weather presenter Alex Beresford adopts a similar tactic with his nine-year-old son Cruz. “When I was growing up, my parents had an open-door policy – we knew we could come to them with any problem, and I’m trying to create that same environment for Cruz,” he says. “But things have changed so much – kids these days have so much tech and so many distractions that it can leave them feeling quite isolated, spending all day in their rooms on their computers.”\\n\\nBut isolation is not just something that is experienced, well, in isolation. “Just because you’re surrounded by people it doesn’t mean you can’t be lonely,” says Buckley. “It’s not helpful to demonise social media, as people often find support and validation there, but the pressure from social media to show your best side and look like you’re living an amazing life can be incredibly isolating.”\\n\\nThe people around us can serve as our early warning system when something is wrong, according to Mind. “Our friends and family are often the best-placed to spot any signs that we might be struggling,” says Buckley. Conscious of this, Beresford and his partner, Natalia Natkaniec, found that introducing screen-free Sundays made more room for family time and helped to open the lines of communication.\\n\\n“Spending time together helps to keep the atmosphere open and relaxed,” says Beresford. “We also make a point of asking Cruz how his day went, and if something’s bothering him, nine times out of 10 he’ll tell us then. I’d hate to think of him going through something and feeling like he couldn’t approach me with a problem, and if you don’t ask, they don’t tell!”\\n\\nWe live in a time when mental health issues are on the rise, and when, according to Mind, only a third of people who need professional help are getting it. Of course, simply talking to someone isn’t a miracle cure, but it can offer a brief release – and maybe a much-needed opportunity to offload – that gives a lot more weight to that casual chat about the weather.\\n\\nBritain Get Talking\\n\\nTo find out more about ITV’s Britain Get Talking campaign, run in collaboration with mental health charities Mind, YoungMinds and SAMH, visit itv.com/britaingettalking or stv.tv/britaingettalking.

Famed for his mouth-watering food shots and on-the-money restaurant recommendations (warning, don’t scroll when hungry), who better to talk us through the delights of brunching? Here’s what he has to say…\\n\\nBrunch is definitely better than breakfast.\\n\\n“To me, brunch is a real celebration of the weekend. Everybody wakes up a little later and it’s a really relaxed way to spend time with friends without wasting an entire day (long, drawn-out lunches can go on forever). Everybody is more friendly during brunch service, too – it’s not as rushed and waiters are less frazzled.”\\n\\nViews can make or break a meal.\\n\\n“One of my favourite brunch spots is Duck and Waffle – on the 40th floor of London’s Heron Tower. Enjoy incredible 360-degree views of the city – you really feel on top of the world when the sun is shining. My best tip is to get the table in the corner – you get dual-aspect views that way. Their dishes are great for sharing – I love the ‘full Elvis’ (waffles with peanut butter, jam, chantilly cream and caramelised bananas). Their cocktails are really innovative – the Grey Goose Breakfast Fizz is very breakfast-friendly, with a hint of marmalade and burnt toast.”\\n\\nCocktails are always a good idea. Unlimited cocktails are even better.\\n\\n“Bottomless brunches are great for a celebratory occasion like a friend’s birthday. If the price is pre-set and the drinks are free-flowing, everyone can just have a fun, communal and fuss-free dining experience. I really enjoy fresh-tasting cocktails, and I’m a big fan of Grey Goose Vodka with Japanese yuzu – a citrus fruit unlike any other, it has a very distinct aroma and flavour, perhaps similar to a cross between a grapefruit and lime … but better! I also like tea-infused cocktails – jasmine and Earl Grey tea-infused cocktails are brilliant for brunch.”\\n\\nI like my eggs sunny side up.\\n\\n“I love fried eggs to be crispy on the outside with an oozing yolk, but I also really like very slow-cooked scrambled eggs with plenty of butter, Bill Granger-style. For a real people-pleaser and great eggs, Cecconi’s do a really good full English with an Italian twist – their Tuscan sausages are delicious. The decor, service and cocktails are spot-on, so it’s a great spot to take parents or in-laws. You can’t go wrong with a classic Bloody Mary to pair with fried eggs – I prefer mine extra spicy with freshly grated horseradish – a match made in heaven!”\\n\\nBut, believe it or not, eggs aren’t compulsory.\\n\\n“Another of my favourite spots is Kaia at the Ned. Kaia is Asian Pacific-inspired and does amazing Hawaiian poke bowls with deconstructed sushi, avocado flowers and sushi rice, served with marinated tuna or sashimi-grade salmon – it makes for a really delicious, healthy brunch. Don’t leave without trying their gyoza dumplings and okonomiyaki omelette, but the best bit is their Bloody Mary – the Umami Mary. They use Grey Goose vodka and sansho pepper for extra zing.”\\n\\nI’m a pancakes-with-bacon guy, personally.\\n\\n“Or waffles. I like that sweet and savoury ‘umami’ taste. I have a sweet tooth, so berries and maple syrup is always good. Usually I’ll suggest everybody orders a few dishes to share – or we get pancakes for the table to finish. Anywhere that has avocado, pancakes, waffles or crispy bacon on the menu gets a thumbs-up from me. I love an Espresso Martini with my pancakes. Sometimes I will go for one with a Middle Eastern twist, adding cardamom and orange blossom water to give it a delicious warming flavour.”\\n\\nKebabs for brunch are a thing, too.\\n\\n“Le Bab is a modern gourmet kebab restaurant and it’s the perfect hangover cure – everything comes with the most incredible sauces. Try a Middle-Eastern style brunch: I love the shakshuka – eggs baked in tomatoes and peppers – which goes perfectly with a Grey Goose Vodka and Elderflower Tonic. Or for something a little fancier, try its sister restaurant, Maison Le Bab. It’s beautifully designed and slightly more grownup (have a cocktail at the bar if you get there early).”\\n\\nPhotos are fine, but be discreet.\\n\\n“For the best pictures, go for a table by the window with lots of natural light – direct sunlight is too harsh. If the food is beautiful, you don’t need to do much. Some bloggers like super close-ups of one dish, or one from above, or the 45-degree angle shot which is more ‘3D’. Don’t use flash or annoy other diners though – try to be discreet. And enjoy your food while it’s hot!”\\n\\nJessie Ware: ‘I feel much more comfortable in my 30s, I'm living victoriously' Read more\\n\\nDon’t rule out brunch at home.\\n\\n“Sometimes when you roll out of bed there’s nothing better than cooking a great brunch in your own surroundings – my partner loves it when we recreate that brunch vibe in our PJs, with the sun shining. Sometimes I’ll make cocktails at home – we love Espresso Martinis as they’re a great twist on that much-needed coffee in the morning. They’re really easy to make, too.”\\n\\n… but get the ingredients right.\\n\\n“When it comes to brunch at home, good eggs are a must – I like Burford Browns with really orange yolks. We have some great butchers near us for amazing sausages and bacon (I like streaky and smoked bacon) but if you’re veggie, some big, juicy portobello mushrooms, roasted with thyme and butter, are really delicious. Making a crisp, bubbling hash is a good way to use up leftover food, too.”\\n\\nCheck out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose.com\\n\\n#LiveVictoriously\", 'It all began with a promise Susan, 61, made to her mum in the early 90s. As they sat watching a documentary about the community of Bogotá, Colombia, she vowed to one day track down her mum’s uncle, who had emigrated to the South American country decades before.\\n\\nBut it was only when Susan signed up to Ancestry that she was able to get properly stuck into unravelling her mum’s family history.\\n\\nSusan holds a photo of her three-times great-grandmother Marjorie May Douglas\\n\\nSusan says: “Neither of my parents talked about their family, and mum’s family died relatively young – she was the last of her family.\\n\\n“I knew her father was a Geordie, and I knew she had an uncle who had emigrated to South America, and one who was in Montreal, but I always felt there were some more things hanging around.\\n\\n“I always believed that my mother’s family held a treasure trove of information.\\n\\n“After I took early retirement and had time to really look into our family history, it turned out I was right.”\\n\\nThe first of three major breakthroughs came when she connected with her mum’s cousin Maria, who was born in Colombia but now lives in Arizona. They connected through a photograph of Maria’s grandmother. Susan was ecstatic, and couldn’t wait to tell her mum that she had tracked down her long-lost family.\\n\\nSusan’s mum sadly passed away last year, which meant she never heard about two more exciting discoveries. Susan found out her grandfather also had an interesting lineage, after she was contacted by a cousin five times removed, Sheila, who had used Ancestry’s DNA kit to expand on her own research.\\n\\nShe told Susan that she is the three-times great granddaughter of Thomas Clough, the father of a dynasty of Northumbrian pipers whose influence continues to today.\\n\\n“If she hadn’t contacted me, I would have known nothing about mum’s Geordie family,” says Susan, who adds that her sister, Alyson, has been particularly enamoured with this area of their history.\\n\\nThere are YouTube videos and books about the Clough family’s importance in English piping, and Susan admits that she thought there must have been a mistake when she saw just how revered the musical clan were.\\n\\nShe says: “They were all miners but also renowned pipers. The last one of them died in the 1980s. There is a photo of him on Ancestry – he looks an old man.\\n\\n“He died when he was only 57, but he looks 80. It shows you exactly what life was like for the miners. Dreadful.”\\n\\nHowever, not all of Susan’s relatives met a sad end. Her three-times great-grandmother Marjorie May Douglas has proved to be one of the most inspirational people in her life … despite dying in 1874.\\n\\nMarjorie was born in 1790 in a remote corner of Perthshire, and after marrying went on to have a total of seven children, and live in London as well as her home village.\\n\\nBut this wasn’t all – at the age of 70, she upped sticks to Illinois, in the US, where she lived until her death in 1874, at the ripe old age of 84.\\n\\nSusan says: “I cannot think of what she’s done. Even going down to London in those days would have been uncomfortable, and then the sailing ship and perhaps a stagecoach travelling thousands of miles to Illinois at the other end.\\n\\nSusan’s ancestor Thomas Clough (right), father of a dynasty of Northumbrian pipers\\n\\n“I printed a photo of her from Ancestry, and she looked very severe, like they always did in those days.\\n\\n“Then I looked again and I realised this was a woman who loved to laugh and loved to giggle, and if she was alive today we would have been laughing non-stop.

I am developing deep feelings for him, but have an inkling that he is a sexually repressed homosexual. I do not want to end up falling in love with him, marrying – having children – only to find out that, although he may have loved me, we never truly shared a sexual attraction.\\n\\nDespite his tender and affectionate nature, I have never felt him to be sexually attracted to me. I often initiate sex (and am often ignored). In previous relationships, I have found myself fending off consistent unwanted advances, and any move on my part would have been taken up. When we do have sex he turns the lights off, and it’s always just before we go to sleep.\\n\\nWhen I raised the idea that he might not be sexually attracted to me, he flipped out, saying I lacked tact. He mentioned early on that he separates “sexual desire” or “sex” from “emotional connection”, which left me aghast: the feeling of being in love, for me, is deeply bound up with sexual and emotional intimacy. I am very troubled and need to know if he wants me.\\n\\nYou have a hunch that something isn’t right, and that’s worth listening to: if you don’t feel desired in a sexual relationship it can be utterly demoralising (I get dozens of letters about this every week), and there’s no reason to put up with this if that’s what is happening, or if this is how the relationship makes you feel.\\n\\nHowever, before you do anything drastic, you may want to look at things a bit differently. I wonder where you learned that a man “wanting you” was defined by “consistent and often unwanted” advances rather than the “tender, affectionate and caring” man you are with at the moment? I consulted Murray Blacket, a sexual and relationship psychotherapist (cosrt.org.uk). “Your fear is that J doesn’t find you sexually attractive, and your defence is that loads of other men have, so you look for suggestions as to why that might be true: ie, he must be gay,” he said. “But people often make a judgment – ‘My boyfriend doesn’t fancy me, therefore he must be gay’ – instead of addressing the more difficult question of what’s going on in their sex life.”\\n\\nJ may be gay, but Blacket put forward some other theories based on experiences with his patients. “J may be less sexually experienced than you – or the men you are used to. He may be shy, lacking in confidence or experience; or you may have mismatched libidoes, or ways of initiating sex. If in response, you are asking J: ‘Are you gay?’ or ‘Why don’t you fancy me?’ in response, that would feel like an attack for any man – but especially if he’s lacking in experience and already nervous.”\\n\\nEqually, if J isn’t making advances towards you in the way you’d like then, naturally enough, you are going to have questions about yourself.\\n\\nSo, what do you do? You may feel it’s too much to go and see a relationship therapist at this stage, but if you’re serious about this man you do need to find a way for you both to be able to communicate. The longer I do this job, the more I see sex as just another form of communication, and the lack of it as a breakdown in communication between a couple. It’s rare to find a couple who can’t communicate, but have great sex.\\n\\nShould my partner use our money to subsidise his adult sons? Read more\\n\\nHow often are you having sex and what do you class as sex? “So many couples [that I see] think that only penetrative sex is sex, or that a man with an erection who can penetrate a woman is the gold standard,” Blacket said. But the truth is, there are many other ways to have sex, feel wanted and desired.\\n\\nBlacket said that “although you may not be asking questions of J in the right way, they are good questions”. He suggested “not doing what I often see happen, which is that one person is unhappy and so they say to their partner, ‘You need to go and get this seen to.’”\\n\\nYou both need to take responsibility for your part in it. Putting him on the defensive isn’t going to make him feel great. Remember: there are two of you in this relationship.\\n\\n• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

Please be aware that there may be a short delay in comments appearing on the site.', 'Pope Francis offered the staff of the Vatican some writing advice in September: “Give up using adjectives” – and also adverbs, as in phrases such as “authentically Christian”, to which he declared himself allergic. I suppose if there’s anyone you can’t condemn for pontificating like this, it’s the pontiff. Yet his advice annoyed me, as did some newly published tips aimed at scientists from the novelist Cormac McCarthy, who turns out to have been giving behind-the-scenes editorial advice to leading researchers for years. “Remove extra words or commas whenever you can,” reads McCarthy’s advice (as paraphrased by two of his academic collaborators). Also: “Don’t overelaborate.” Though he’s less of a stickler than Francis when it comes to adjectives: “Only use an adjective if it’s relevant.” In short, we’re back to William Strunk and EB White’s famous advice in The Elements Of Style: “Omit needless words.”\\n\\nMy issue with all this isn’t the fact that you can – who’d have guessed it? – find plenty of adjectives and adverbs in the pope’s own writing. Nor is it that McCarthy’s admonition against overelaboration is redundant. (Of course you shouldn’t overelaborate; that’s why they call it overelaboration.) As the linguist Geoff Pullum notes, “omit needless words” is a bit suspect, too, since clearly you shouldn’t omit needful words, so the word “needless” is itself needless. So “omit words” might make more sense, except that it’s stupid. No, my issue with all this advice to eliminate unnecessary verbiage is: unnecessary for what? Claims of necessity or superfluity imply some end goal, but it’s rare to see one explicitly stated.\\n\\nAfter all, the complex scientific jargon that McCarthy disdains isn’t usually there, I’d argue, because the authors knew no better; it’s because their goal isn’t solely to communicate, but also to signal their knowledge and qualifications. (This is a bad goal to aim for, I’d say. But so long as academics have powerful incentives to do so, style advice won’t solve things.)\\n\\nDo as much as you can – not as little as you can get away with | Oliver Burkeman Read more\\n\\nMeanwhile, a talented novelist can harness verbosity to good communicative ends. How many of the words in Lucy Ellman’s new 1,000-page novel Ducks, Newburyport are needful? For that matter, how many novels are needful at all? How many of the words ever written truly had to be written, other than signs saying things like “Dangerous cliff edge, keep away”, or “Warning: contains bleach”?\\n\\nIn any case, my hunch is that verbosity of the bad kind rarely arises because the writer hasn’t yet been told, whether by popes or novelists, to cut it out. Rather, it arises when you haven’t properly figured out what it is you’re trying to say. Whenever I’m stuck on how to express something – or I read my writing back, and have the feeling that it’s missing the point – the problem is never one of style. It’s that I haven’t clarified exactly what that point is, and that I’ve been engaged in a subconscious effort to avoid having to do so.\\n\\nSo instead of “omit needless words”, try “invest needful effort”. Make yourself do the job of pinpointing your message, in your own mind, and the writing will come easily. I mean, it probably will. Unlike some, I wouldn’t claim to be infallible.\\n\\nRead this\\n\\n\\n\\nSteven Pinker’s book The Sense Of Style draws on evolutionary theory to show you how to tailor your language to our millennia-old brains.', 'I was in my late 30s when my husband of seven years died unexpectedly. He had been unwell for years, but not terminally ill, so his death was a shock and left me numb, unable to fathom physical intimacy. Several months after losing him, I could have put my hand on the hob and not felt a thing.\\n\\nSeven months on, a confused Adonis 12 years my junior followed me around like a puppy on my summer travels, and it dawned on me that a second chance at a fulfilling sex life was mine for the taking. I was flooded with guilt: my husband and I had enjoyed natural intimacy from the start, but over the years our sex life had waned considerably as his physical and mental health issues increased. Miraculously, our sex life experienced a renaissance the month before his death.\\n\\nA year on, I decided to spend a dirty weekend with an ex with whom I’d had electric sexual chemistry but zero romantic interest. He’d reached out to offer condolences, and I ended up visiting him in the picturesque European village where he’d relocated, joking with friends that I was a sex tourist and he’d “pop my widow cherry”.\\n\\nMy life in sex: the partner of a man with erectile dysfunction Read more\\n\\nAfter that, the floodgates opened.

Please be aware that there may be a short delay in comments appearing on the site.', 'In 2005, when my wife Sharon and I saw the Skirrid Inn in Monmouthshire was looking for new owners, we didn’t think twice. We had been running a pub in Hertfordshire and looking for an opportunity to return to our Welsh roots; the Skirrid offered that. With its reputation for paranormal activity, it couldn’t have been more different from the beautiful thatched pub we were leaving; but I love places full of history and intrigue. I enjoy horror films, too.\\n\\nWalk in and it’s like entering a castle, with stone-flagged floors everywhere. It’s said there was a building here as early as 1110 and, though it’s impossible to verify, we do claim to be the oldest pub in Wales – most of the main bar dates from the Tudor period, and upstairs, where our guests stay, was a courtroom until Cromwell’s time. Many of the alleged ghosts are connected to that room. Local legend has it that George Jeffreys, the notorious 17th-century “hanging judge”, may have heard cases here, and that 182 people have been executed in the building. We keep a noose on the staircase, hanging from the beam that was supposedly used; it has score marks on it said to have been caused by the weight of hanging bodies.\\n\\nThough I’m sceptical about these stories, during the 14 years we’ve been here, I’ve experienced my fair share of unexplained phenomena. On our first night at the inn, before we’d even taken over, we were sleeping in a big four-poster bed when Sharon complained of something tugging on her leg. It happened several times during the night and we had to keep turning the lights on. Of course, there was nothing there, but we barely slept. Later, we learned that relatives of people who were slow to die during a hanging would yank on their loved ones’ legs to end their suffering. I was quite shaken by that.\\n\\nNot long after that, my young grandson went to the toilet and came back complaining, “The man in the long dress won’t let me in!” There was no one else in the place at the time – even Sharon was out. Brave man that I am, I made him hang on until she came back.\\n\\nI’ve only once seen a full figure – a coachman-like character in a tricorn hat, standing in the porch in broad daylight. He caught my eye for a second or two, then was gone. That was about eight years ago and since then I’ve sometimes thought, “Did I really see that?” Obviously it would be great for business if I kept coming out with these stories, but I do question everything.\\n\\nThe pub attracts a lot of psychics, paranormal investigators and TV crews. I’ve seen a few dodgy spiritualists over the years, but the ones who genuinely seem to believe in what they’re doing and don’t take themselves too seriously are always welcome. Our bar regulars get on well with the visitors – they love showing them around and telling their own uncanny stories. Most of the staff have had strange encounters, too – we’ve had glasses and customers’ change flying off the bar, unexplained cold spots in rooms, and one young woman who said an unseen presence whispered, then roared in her ear.\\n\\nExperience: I grew up in a cemetery Read more\\n\\nOur best-known former resident is an 18th-century barmaid called Fanny Price, who died of consumption and is buried in the local churchyard. She has been spotted frequently and people often say they can smell lavender just before she appears. There have been more troubling manifestations – on half a dozen occasions, guests have shown me strange marks that have appeared around their necks – but there’s only been one instance of outright malevolence that I’m aware of. A woman came running down from one of the bedrooms, hair wet and dressed only in a coat, saying, “She tried to kill me!” Apparently she’d been in the bath and something had held her down under the water. I thought it was interesting that she said “she” rather than “he” or “it”, but she didn’t stick around to explain and I’ve been unable to contact her since.\\n\\nSceptical as I am, I don’t take any chances and I do maintain the local tradition of every night putting out the Pwcca Cup, a special tankard filled with ale to appease the devil. On a windy night this time of year, when I go outside and the pub sign is swinging and the wind’s howling, I do look over my shoulder. One day I’m going to turn round and something’s going to be there. I think it will be the end of me. Especially if it’s a clown. They scare me to death.\\n\\n• As told to Chris Broughton\\n\\nDo you have an experience to share? Email experience@theguardian.com', 'Generating a thousand waves an hour to suit everyone from beginners to pros, The Wave opens near Bristol this weekend. We go for a test ride\\n\\n‘Yeee-ees!!” cries my coach, Oliver, as we near the water’s edge. Wave after wave surges towards us, peeling sideways before crumbling at our feet. No closeouts, no guessing where waves will break, just perfect peaks stretching into the distance.\\n\\nMost surfers would be stoked to see this at any beach in the world, but I’m eight miles from Bristol’s centre and three from the English “coast” (if you can call the muddy Severn estuary that) at a man-made surfing venue that opens on 26 October.\\n\\nThis £26m project, called The Wave, features a vast, cove-shaped lagoon which can produce up to 1,000 waves per hour, from whitewater for beginners to 1.8-metre barrelling sections for dudes. There’s a wooden-clad ops building with changing, dining and viewing facilities, created with accessibility and sustainability in mind. Beyond it, meadowlands and camping plots are under construction.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A surfing instructor at The Wave\\n\\nA local’s guide to Bristol: 10 top tips Read more\\n\\n“It’s the kind of stuff you dream about as a kid,” Oliver says with awe. “I think I used to scribble drawings of this.”\\n\\nAs a self-taught surfer of limited skill, I’ve signed up for a 90-minute intermediate lesson – hardly enough time to unpick five years of bad habits. After a warm-up, Oliver introduces me to my board: a large, lime green “foamie”. He says: “What we’re teaching here is exactly the same techniques as at the ocean, from popping up, to currents, to line-up situations, but here we can turn around and look back at exactly the same waves and reassess things. It’s an amazing pathway for learning.”\\n\\nThe lagoon is filled with drinking-quality water, and when I dip my toes in I’m glad I heeded his advice to wear a 5mm wetsuit and booties (included in the admission fee, along with boards). Within a minute, Oliver is pushing me into my first wave. “That was perfect,” he says, almost apologetically, as I pop up and ride through the whitewater.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A beginner makes progress.\\n\\nMy performance nosedives thereafter – figuratively and literally – and the next 30 minutes feel like a one-man audition for kook of the day. Oliver remains upbeat, adjusting my stance and guiding me into waves with encouragement. Then comes a lightbulb moment: “You have to think about coming through, not popping up explosively,” he says. Suddenly, the lagoon is no longer my nemesis.\\n\\nThe idea of building a surfing lake in Bristol came to The Wave’s founder, Nick Hounsfield, an osteopath and lifelong surfer, in 2011. He wanted to “create a health and wellbeing destination that was safe and cohesive”, open to people who might often feel excluded through “disability, illness, age, gender, background, income, fears”.\\n\\nHe contacted Basque firm Wavegarden, but saw their initial designs, used at Surf Snowdonia in Wales, the UK’s first artificial surfing lake, run into issues early on. Luckily, Wavegarden fashioned a new concept. “Snowdonia is powered by an underwater foil, so when they have problems they have to drain the lake,” says Nick. “We’ve got 40 paddles which slide forwards and backwards on a simple rack and pinion system. It’s basic engineering. A computer co-ordinates those paddles, and the lake bed is sculpted like an ocean reef to create different types of waves.”\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The technology is provided by Basque firm Wave garden\\n\\nThe 70 acres of former agricultural land a short distance from the M5 are highly accessible but removed from the bustle of Bristol. They hope to attract around 150,000 visitors per year and are already planning another venue in London’s Lee Valley.\\n\\n“If you close your eyes, it sounds just like the ocean out here,” says Nick. “But oh my goodness, it’s waves on tap.”\\n\\nHaving surfed at Snowdonia last year, I can’t tell the difference, but the advanced surfers I meet are beaming. “I had a blast, people are going to love it,” says board-shaper and Wave ambassador Ben Skinner.\\n\\nWales’ perfect new wave: Snowdonia’s inland surfing lake Read more\\n\\nThe technology allows elite surfers to practise where the biggest waves are generated, while beginners can learn in the safety of the shallows, as they would at a natural beach. What is hugely noticeable is the sense of camaraderie. With up to 80 surfers of differing abilities in the lagoon at any one time – grouped by ability and overseen by “hosts” and coaches (there’s one for every eight people in the beginners’ section) – you’re more likely to have “rival” surfers praise your takeoff than snake your wave.\\n\\nAt the end of my session, I convince my coach to let me try the advanced waves. “This is my defining moment,” I joke. “No, don’t put that pressure on yourself; it’s just another wave,” Oliver replies. The lagoon is empty and I feel the eyes of a dozen spectators on me. “Paddle, paddle, paddle,” Oliver yells. I pop up fairly smoothly before wrestling my way to the shore. I’m greeted with high-fives from staff. “Everyone in the control room was whooping – they were like ‘he’s up!’” one tells me.\\n\\nI’m simultaneously relieved and thrilled: it’s remarkable how easily frustrations can be swept away by one man-made wave.\\n\\n• The Wave, Washingpool Farm, Easter Compton, Bristol, thewave.com.

The Betterment sounds like a Gwyneth Paltrow home-learning seminar series, where for $800 you can learn six life-enhancing ways to arrange a radish plate.\\n\\nThe Betterment is, in fact, the new restaurant from Jason Atherton, who, like the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, now also has an empire that the sun never sets on. Atherton is everywhere in London, and he’s in Shanghai, Dubai, Doha, New York, Cebu and St Moritz, too; doing everything all of the time, excelling at innovative, dramatic cocktails and luxury dining that doesn’t befuddle. He spreads himself thin and aims big, never truly messing up, and never looking anything less than bushy-tailed and dapper in public. This has led me to wonder if there are three, or possibly four, Jason Athertons out there, and if so, one of them is hellbent on incessantly winding up his former employer, Gordon Ramsay.\\n\\nThis may well be why Atherton’s newest place is directly opposite Ramsay’s ironically titled Lucky Cat, which I’d rather dine on a Felix duck and lamb in jelly wet pouch than visit again.\\n\\nSunday with Jason Atherton: ‘It’s all about rest, relaxation and ice-cream’ Read more\\n\\nMore sensibly, Atherton is a master at choosing and delegating to great staff. Here, chef Paul Walsh, ex of City Social, and the diligent front-of-house team make what could have been a stiff, corporate-focused, fine-dining borefest into a thoroughly acceptable night.\\n\\nIn any other top-name chef’s mitts, The Betterment, inside the The Biltmore hotel on Grosvenor Square, could be a horrible mess, regardless of the steak tartare with beef dripping croutons the size of roast potatoes or the very delicious onion “flower” with chive emulsion (it’s a deep-fried onion, splayed to resemble a sort of floral octopus, with fancy mayo, and definitely a must-order).\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Betterment’s onion ‘flower’: Atherton’s riff on the US steakhouse mainstay is a ‘must-order’.\\n\\nNevertheless, the Biltmore is the sort of hotel no one who is remotely from Planet Earth ever stays at. It’s a vast, showy, 251-room, 57-suite luxury, Hilton LXR collection, Mayfair rich-person’s mothership, close to Selfridge’s, where the rooms start at £600 a night and you’d stay only if money was simply an airy concept over which you heard other people worry.\\n\\nThe Betterment, to be blunt, is a slice off the back end of this. In fact, if you’re sitting in its very prettiest, starriest section – al fresco, under heaters, romantically lit, next to an Instagram hotspot greenery wall – it will strike you after a while that you’re essentially sitting in a repurposed car park, watching hotel guests arrive and leave. Some of the inside tables, closest to the front of the hotel, are awful, like a drab, grey breakfast room.\\n\\nBut I did enjoy The Betterment, and I would go back. It is a new place with old-school glamour, with receptionists in off-the-shoulder LBDs and handsome, besuited males foisting warm sourdough and salted butter under your nose, following on from a cocktail containing something strong with Dubonnet and Silent Pool gin and named Tea Time With The Queen. With dinner, I drank the cheapest Can Sumoi Xarel·lo at £12 a glass, and well aware that this was possibly disappointing for the sommelier.\\n\\nOur meal is much more hearty than the menu suggests, because on paper it is a cacophony of snow pea, langoustine crudo and horseradish velouté. In actuality, chalk steam trout and potato cake with curry sauce is a tarted-up fishcake in a puddle of light, coronation-style liquor: delicate, fishy and finickity in design, but still dinner.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Betterment’s short rib with bone marrow: ‘An assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of meaty, cheesy decadence.’\\n\\nJohn dory with a sauce of coco de Paimpol beans and bordelaise sauce is really very little to get het up about. Short-rib with Montgomery cheddar does exactly what it promises: it is an assertive, umami-heavy, emotional battering of bone marrow-encrusted, meaty, cheesy decadence; if you have that with the fried onion and some of The Betterment’s “chips”, which are fried in beef dripping and come with a ketchup laced with truffle, you may find yourself in need of a sedan chair.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘World-class’: The Betterment’s bitter chocolate tart.\\n\\nThis won’t be aided by a slice of the generously portioned dark chocolate tart with glorious, deeply scented Tahitian vanilla ice-cream, which I thought to be world-class.\\n\\nJason Atherton may not have opened the best restaurant in the West End of London this year, but he has opened a more delicious one than Gordon Ramsay.

In April 2019, the Columbia Journalism Review said, 'For some time now, by far the best daily reporting on climate change has come from the Guardian, which covers the science, politics, economics, and health aspects throughout the world with great force and clarity.' We will prioritise and give prominence to environmental journalism from The Guardian and Observer, bringing you the news and information you need. Our reporting on the environment, from our international team, will never be influenced by commercial or political interests and will always be rooted in scientific fact.\\n\\nWe will report on how environmental collapse is already affecting people around the world, including during natural disasters and extreme weather events. We will bring you the world’s leading voices on the climate crisis, and we will cover issues across food, travel and lifestyle in order to help readers live sustainably. We will undertake investigations into the economic and political structures that underpin the carbon economy, and examine the role the climate crisis plays in many other critical issues - including inequality, migration and the battle over scarce resources.\\n\\nWe will use language that recognises the severity of the crisis we’re in. In May 2019, the Guardian updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world, using “climate emergency, crisis or breakdown” and “global heating” instead of “climate change” and “global warming”. We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on the urgency of this issue.\\n\\nThe Guardian will achieve net zero emissions by 2030. We are developing a detailed plan for how to achieve this, involving a full audit of our emissions. Our priority will be to reduce our carbon footprint meaningfully and permanently.\\n\\nWe will be transparent with our progress. We have announced today that we have become the first news organisation to acquire BCorp certification, which means joining a community of businesses from across the globe who openly commit to driving positive societal change. This is an important milestone in public transparency and accountability for our global environmental footprint.\\n\\nEnvironmental journalism from the Guardian and the Observer has a powerful impact around the world and we have received financial support from readers in more than 180 countries. This support means we can keep Guardian journalism accessible to everyone. We hope you will consider supporting Guardian journalism today with a contribution or subscription — every form of support, however big or small, is so valuable for our future.\\n\\nSupport the Guardian\\n\\nContribute\\n\\nSubscribe\", 'We recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”\\n\\nThe rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.\\n\\nAnother reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”\\n\\nTravel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world.\\n\\nBut we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.\\n\\nThe majority of locations we feature in the Guardian’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.\\n\\nOur Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.\\n\\nOn our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.\\n\\nOne of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.\\n\\nWe still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.\\n\\nTourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”\\n\\nThe Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.\\n\\nJohn Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”\\n\\nReturning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”\\n\\nBecause, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”\\n\\nThat is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section.', 'Jamie Wilson, foreign news editor, and Simon Jeffery, deputy foreign editor\\n\\nThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.\\n\\nFor many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.\\n\\nIn the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.\\n\\nSuch events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.\\n\\nIn Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.\\n\\nOur reporters have also travelled to where governments and individuals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.\\n\\nThere are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.\\n\\nClimate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.\\n\\nJulia Finch, business editor\\n\\nBusiness and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.\\n\\nFrom giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.\\n\\nThese are huge questions, and Guardian readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.\\n\\nOur economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.\\n\\nWe are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.\\n\\nWriting in the Guardian earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.\\n\\nWithout action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn.\\n\\nBanks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.\\n\\nMany companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.\\n\\nWe are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.\\n\\nOur reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.\\n\\nMost corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.\\n\\nInvestment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal & General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”\\n\\nHowever, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”\\n\\nThey do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.\\n\\nJess Cartner-Morley, associate editor (Fashion)\\n\\nFashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the most\\n\\nimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.\\n\\nWe aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. We\\n\\nwill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readers\\n\\nparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.\\n\\nWe have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.\\n\\nWhat does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintage\\n\\npieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.\\n\\nNone of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.\\n\\nTim Lusher, editor of Feast\\n\\nThere’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.\\n\\nMeat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.\\n\\nAs well as covering the environmental impact of food production, we’re thinking about what we publish in lifestyle terms. The Guardian’s archive contains nearly 10,000 recipes, of which 19% use meat of some kind, but that figure is down to 15% for articles created in 2018 and 2019. We aim to run recipes that use only sustainable fish (we follow the Marine Conservation Society’s Good Fish Guide in the UK and associates in the US and Australia). Food is complicated though and it’s not all about meat. Almonds and avocados use a huge amount of water. Generally, it feels an era to be mindful – we have a zero waste column and readers love its inventive, resourceful, frugal ideas.\\n\\nIt’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, divided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the Guardian.', \"Guardian picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency\\n\\nAt the Guardian we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.\\n\\nThe Guardian's climate pledge 2019 Read more\\n\\nOur goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the Guardian. We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.\\n\\nThe concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man and his child wear masks to protect them from heavy smog as they visit Waitan in December 2013 in Shanghai, China.

Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\\n\\nIt was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.\\n\\nWe know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.\\n\\nSo it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the individual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this:\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A wildfire burns uphill in the Appalachian mountains.

So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.\\n\\nToday we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands | Katharine Viner Read more\\n\\nIn June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.\\n\\nThe photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.\\n\\nIt is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, biodiversity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.\\n\\nAs our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.\\n\\nHowever, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.\\n\\nIf you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@guardian.co.uk to join our conversation.\", 'If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photos\\n\\nHave you spotted any new buds or flowers in October?\\n\\nAccording to former Guardian environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.\\n\\nSome people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.\\n\\nIf you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.\\n\\nHow to get in touch\\n\\nWhen did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

However, poverty resulting from high unemployment and inequality result in high crime rates and extensive gender-based violence. Business is hoarding capital, resulting in low investment rates, once more contributing to high unemployment. Those in power (business and otherwise) don’t seem to care how rampant economic inequality is contributing to the very same ills they bemoan. They seem to be happy behind their gated communities, forgetting that they won’t be insulated forever.

The constitutional right to movement has changed so people of colour are able to move in different areas.

Today I have a 2m wall, electric gates, CCTV, electric fence and armed response.\\n\\nWhite areas are still well kept, large plots, and relatively safe. The best schools are still in the white areas. It’s unbelievable but true that if you live in a leafy suburb like Constantia and work in the city, you’ll think you’re in Europe while less than 15km in the opposite direction people still have little access to proper toilets and live in ramshackle houses.

The schools in Joburg (both public and private) are far more reflective of the actual demographics of the city. Joburg has had a significant growth in its black middle class and and I think it is the most cosmopolitan city in the country. Just look at the recent SA supporters at the Rugby World Cup in Japan: there has been a significant increase in black support for what was historically a very white-dominated sport. The idea of a rainbow nation that Nelson Mandela’s era inspired is unfortunately a long-term aspiration that will probably take another generation or two to achieve. I don’t think the damage of 50 years of apartheid can be undone in 25 years.

The most noticeable change is that you see black and white people, especially children, playing together in the streets or walking around shopping malls without the police questioning them or their parents. You see black and white people eating at the same restaurants and talking to each other in public.\\n\\nBut in the area where we live, which was a white Group Area during apartheid, most of the residents are still white.

Some suburbs have thus become better integrated and more diverse, which is an improvement. However, some areas remain composed of predominantly one racial group because of socio-economic reasons. The new divisions in where people live are along economic lines rather than racial lines, but because apartheid economically and otherwise disadvantaged black and coloured people, the economic lines tend to mirror the racial lines. The cost of living and unemployment has increased, so many people are poorer. The number of townships in Cape Town has increased, because once restriction on movement ended, many people also moved to the cities from rural areas looking for jobs. Although the government has provided new housing since the end of apartheid, the increase in people moving to the city has meant that they are unable to keep up with the demand for housing and other facilities.”\\n\\nAnonymous, former Cape Town resident\\n\\n'Only we can change things': life in the gang-ridden other side of Cape Town Read more\\n\\n‘South African cities are slowly integrating’\\n\\n“South African cities are slowly integrating, and will eventually integrate completely, but progress has been slow. This is mostly because a big wealth gap remains between the average white and black South African – and this is largely as a result of poor governance. In spite of good black economic empowerment policies, government incompetence, corruption, and poor economic policies have stifled economic growth and impeded economic growth and the upliftment of poor South Africans into the middle class. There is hope however that this will improve under Cyril Ramaphosa.”\\n\\nMurray, 52, Cape Town\\n\\n‘I walk today without labels in this beautiful town’\\n\\n“It is undeniable that I live in a better Cape Town than the one my parents lived in. I was born in 1987 and registered as a ‘Cape coloured’ man. I walk today without labels in the streets of this beautiful town. However, for all the breakthroughs we’ve experienced, apartheid is pretty much still alive in the townships and the economic structures. By ‘developing’ housing projects in the old townships, government has solidified the geography of apartheid.

But Alexa’s locked up 2,400 miles away, at an immigration detention center in Arizona.\\n\\nAlexa, 23, and her six-year-old niece arrived at the US border from Guatemala in early 2019, after gang members murdered much of their family and Alexa was left as the sole caretaker of the little girl. It’s been more than seven months since US officials on the Arizona border separated them. It’s the longest they have ever been apart. Now they are in the hands of a system that won’t make it easy for them to reunite.\\n\\nCall it a miracle: how strangers got two caravan families across the border Read more\\n\\nThe public outcry over forced family separations at the border last year has faded from the headlines, yet migrant families continue to be separated today. A federal judge in San Diego ordered the Trump administration in the summer of 2018 to reunite families and stop separating most parents and children. But the court order does not apply to non-parents, and the administration keeps separating people like Alexa – aunts, grandparents or older siblings who commonly step in as guardians without formal paperwork – from the children they’re traveling with, without any procedure to reunite them. (The government also continues splitting up some children from their parents, citing reasons such as the parents’ criminal history.)\\n\\nFigures obtained on Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) through litigation reveal the federal government separated at least 1,556 more children from their parents than it had previously disclosed, bringing the number of known cases to more than 5,460. “The family separation practice was worse than we thought in the past and is still ongoing,” says Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrant Rights Project. The overall tally would be larger still if it included families like Alexa and her niece, but no one has tracked the number of children separated from non-parent adult relatives.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rally against Donald Trump’s immigrant family separation policies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 30 June 2018.

Her memories come at night, amid the screams of other detainees who plead to be released or beg for cigarettes. She wakes up feeling like someone is hunting her. She knows she’s seen too much death.\\n\\nWhen we talk about family separation, we are not just talking about DNA families Anthony Enriquez\\n\\nAlexa, who did not want her real name or niece’s name disclosed for fear of reprisal, told her story over a series of phone calls from the Eloy detention center, located 64 miles (103km) from Phoenix, Arizona. During a brief visit at the center, she spoke softly, without ever erasing her welcoming smile. A white rosary peeked out from underneath her dark green uniform.\\n\\nWhen Alexa thinks about her family she bows her head to cry. She says she was a teenager when gang members beat her mother to death in front of her in Guatemala over a longstanding land dispute. Two years later, in 2013, the gang returned and murdered her father and sister in the family’s rural home. Alexa managed to flee and looked for help. When she returned home with the police, she found her dead sister’s eight-month-old baby near death, choking in a pool of blood, her little legs bound. The baby was in shock and could not cry.\\n\\nAlexa, then 17, suddenly found herself the sole caregiver of her niece. “Every time she cried, I cried with her,” she says. “We grew up together.”\\n\\nShe worked cleaning jobs so she could buy the baby milk, she says. She went on to have a son of her own, but he fell ill and died suddenly at 22 months. In 2018, the gang that killed her family fatally shot her partner outside the couple’s home. The gang shot at Alexa, too, and she fled with the girl, who was five by then.\\n\\nThe federal prosecutor’s office in Guatemala told Alexa they couldn’t help her because the men were too dangerous and advised her to leave the country, she recalls. After she made it to Mexico’s northern border in early 2019, she resolved to apply for political asylum in the US, ruling out living in Mexico because of gangs and violence there. She didn’t know that she could be separated from the girl when she started her journey. “The United States is the only country that can protect you,” she says.\\n\\nAmerican volunteers at her migrant shelter in Mexico helped her obtain copies of the child’s birth certificate and family death certificates, which prove her relatives were murdered. The volunteers also gave her a letter to carry, which stated she didn’t agree to be separated from the child.\\n\\nShe assured the girl they would stay together, that in the US, everything would be better. But when they got to the Lukeville, Arizona, port of entry and she asked for asylum, she was told they would be split up and the girl would be sent to New York. It would take Alexa days before she understood that was a state thousands of miles away.\\n\\n“The girl was clinging to me,” Alexa recalls, adding that a female customs officer ripped her from her arms nonetheless. Alexa remembers the girl’s cries and the officer telling her to shut up. “You can’t do this without my permission,” Alexa recalls saying. “‘Of course, I can,’ she told me.”\\n\\n•••\\n\\nChildren who arrive at the border without a parent or legal guardian – even if they come with an adult relative – are considered “unaccompanied” and are sent to child shelters, according to a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson. These protocols “ensure the safety of the child”, the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail. The government requires legal guardians to show adoption papers or a court order, neither of which Alexa has.\\n\\nBut some advocates say the government should broaden its definition of legal guardian to include longstanding adult caregivers. Michelle Brané, director of migrant rights and justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission, is disappointed the government has so far refused to take that step. “Because really the whole point of all of this is to do what’s in the best interests of the child,” Brané says.\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Border patrol officers talk with a group of Central American asylum seekers before taking them into custody on 12 June 2018 near McAllen, Texas. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images\\n\\nOnce separated, there’s no real mechanism for reuniting children with the adult relatives who raised them, says attorney Catherine Weiss, the chair of the pro bono practice at Lowenstein Sandler, which represents immigrant children in both individual cases and class actions. “It is regularly the case that the adult who crossed with that child will be removed while the child remains.”\\n\\nIn fact, Brané says when these caregivers are separated from children at the border, it’s not even “necessarily noted in the file anywhere that this separation occurred or who the adult is that brought the child in”.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has issued legal guidance that makes it harder for Central Americans fleeing violence to qualify for asylum. And under Trump, immigrants who ask for asylum at ports of entry are typically forced to remain in detention until their cases are resolved.\\n\\nAlexa spent 15 days without any news of what had happened to her child, until a psychologist at the detention center helped arrange for a phone call. The girl had been placed with a temporary foster family in New York City.\\n\\nVolunteers Alexa had met at the shelter in Mexico learned of her situation and rallied to help. They found her pro bono attorneys and requested the girl’s case be overseen by an independent child advocate, a service available to some unaccompanied immigrant children in government custody. The child advocate got federal officials to allow Alexa and her niece to call twice a week.\\n\\nFor many other families like Alexa’s, phone calls with children don’t happen at all, says Weiss, the attorney. “If that person is not the biological parent or legal guardian, there is no guarantee of communication.”\\n\\n•••\\n\\nAn immigration judge has found Alexa’s case credible and acknowledged she suffered harm, but denied her case met the complex legal standard for asylum. Her attorney Suzannah Maclay has filed an intent to appeal but says the case could take over two years to reach a resolution, given the current backlog in cases and the Trump administration’s constant changes to the immigration system. There is a chance, however, Alexa could be released from detention sooner through other legal motions.\\n\\nLike other separated caregivers, she’s now facing dueling priorities: enduring detention long enough to defend herself from deportation back to danger, and reuniting with her child as quickly as possible – even when there is no clear path to do so.\\n\\nIn detention, most days resemble one another. She sleeps as much as she can. Her uniform makes her feel like a criminal. The food is always the same – “potatoes, potatoes and more potatoes”. She is often sick to her stomach, and sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether it is the food or the anxiety of not knowing what will happen next.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Mexican woman holds a doll next to children at the Paso del Norte port of entry at the US-Mexico border on 20 June 2018. Photograph: Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nSometimes she is hopeful. She has heard from the child advocate maybe the girl can be transferred to Arizona and they can have brief reunions in the detention visitor room. She is learning to read in English and Spanish, so she can understand her legal documents rather than just stare at them.\\n\\nIncreasingly, though, she thinks it’s better to be deported than keep fighting in detention. Her heart aches for her child, and it’s hard to accept that the girl she raised as a daughter now lives with strangers. “Without her I feel like everything is over,” she says.\\n\\nI’ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum Alexa\\n\\n“I am desperate and depressed,” she says. “I’ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum.”\\n\\nBut if she were to return to Guatemala, she knows she wouldn’t be safe. “They are looking for me to kill me,” she says. And she fears an American family will adopt the little girl if she were to return, though legal advocates say that rarely happens.\\n\\nIt’s more likely if Alexa were to be deported, the child’s advocate would arrange for the girl to also return to Guatemala – even though it could take months for her to follow. Alexa would probably have to board a plane alone, trusting the government and advocates to ensure her child would one day join her.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Alexa looks forward to those days when she talks to her girl. Sometimes they make small talk about the dolls the girl plays with, or the school she attends. Other times, she tells Alexa she has a magic wand that will make the distance between them disappear. There’s not a call when the girl doesn’t ask how much longer they will have to wait to be together. Alexa has to say it’s all in the hands of a judge.\\n\\nIt’s tough to explain to a six-year-old she protected all her life that she’s now powerless. She’s all the family Alexa has. “And I’m not willing to lose her,” she says.', 'In a recent survey, Poles were asked to identify what they felt to be the biggest threats facing them in the 21st century, choosing from options such as the climate crisis, renewed aggression from Russia and a possible economic downturn.\\n\\nAmong men under 40, the most popular answer was “the LGBT movement and gender ideology”. The survey, conducted by Ipsos for the Polish website OKO.press, suggested that a government campaign against the nebulous concept of “LGBT ideology” was having an impact.\\n\\nIn Poland, and elsewhere in central Europe, there has been a notable rise in tolerance and empathy towards the LGBT community in recent years, illustrated by the emergence of a confident new generation of activists in smaller towns and cities. But across the region, populist politicians and church leaders are using the issue to mobilise their conservative bases.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the continent’s biggest annual gathering of LGBT activists was told that the iron curtain that once divided Europe between communist east and capitalist west remained intact for gay and transgender people, amid a rising tide of homophobic hatred, violence and discrimination.\\n\\nAdéla Horáková, an advocacy director at the Czech group We Are Fair, said that 30 years after the end of communism, former eastern bloc countries still lagged behind their western European counterparts in granting fair and equal treatment to members of the LGBT community.\\n\\n“The iron curtain … still stands,” Horáková said at the opening of the three-day ILGA conference in Prague. “While life for them isn’t perfect on either side of the [former] curtain, in none of the eastern European countries can they get married, in none of them can same-sex couples jointly adopt children.”\\n\\nThat message will resonate with activists in Poland, where senior members of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) have engaged in an increasingly ferocious campaign portraying so-called “LGBT ideology” as a menace akin to that of Soviet-imposed communism. In the run-up to parliamentary elections this month, which PiS narrowly won, the “LGBT issue” emerged as one of the main campaign grounds.\\n\\nZbigniew Nosowski, the editor-in-chief of Więź, a relatively liberal Catholic quarterly in Warsaw, said the tactic was seen to have worked in May’s European elections. “They provoked people who were usually passive in the elections to come to the polls and vote, because they perceived the threat from supposed LGBT and gender ideology with anxiety,” he said.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Pride parade in Lublin, eastern Poland, which was harassed by anti-LGBT disrupters. Photograph: Wojtek Radwański/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nBefore the May elections, the PiS leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, told a gathering of lay Catholics in the central city of Włocławek that “these ideologies, philosophies, all of this is imported, these are not internal Polish mechanisms. They are a threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state.”\\n\\nSince then, the rhetoric has only escalated. Kaczyński insinuated that homosexual couples wanted the right to adopt children out of a desire for sexual gratification. The archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski, referred to the perceived threat from gay rights campaigners as a “rainbow plague”, comparing it to Nazism and Soviet communism, in a sermon to mark the 75th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising.\\n\\n“He didn’t call the people a plague, he called the ideology a plague,” said archbishop Stanisław Gądecki, the head of the Polish episcopate, in an interview in Warsaw in September, claiming it was akin to attacking communism while respecting individual people who were communists.\\n\\nIn Hungary, where the church is less powerful than in Poland, there is less deep-rooted homophobia. Budapest was one of the first cities in the region to have pride marches. But in recent months the ruling Fidesz party of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has begun what appears to be a coordinated homophobic campaign.\\n\\nA Fidesz MP called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after the brand ran an advertising campaign featuring a gay couple, while the speaker of the Hungarian parliament, László Kövér, a close Orbán ally, has made a series of homophobic comments. “Morally, there is no difference between the behaviour of a paedophile and the behaviour of someone who demands such things,” he said when talking about gay marriage and adoption.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People march from the parliament building in Budapest downtown during a LGBT Pride parade in July. Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe LGBT community could provide a useful new target for Orbán after several years of relentless messaging about the dangers of migration from the Middle East and Africa.\\n\\n“One of the main basics of the politics of Fidesz is to provide a common enemy for the Hungarians,” said Ádám András Kanicsár, a Hungarian journalist and LGBT activist. “These enemies were immigrants, then came Brussels and the EU, and then George Soros. But all of these enemies got boring for the audience, so they always have to find a new one. And the new ones are the LGBTQ people and rainbow families who are, according to Fidesz, dangerous to classical Catholic values and the Hungarian families.”\\n\\nIn the Czech Republic, attitudes are even more progressive, with a recent survey showing 61% of people supported a bill currently under consideration that would legally enshrine gay marriage. But here too, conservative politicians are rallying part of their base with homophobic rhetoric disguised as a promotion of “traditional values”.\\n\\nPartly as a result, the bill has become ensnared in the chamber of deputies, the Czech parliament’s lower house, at the first reading stage. Attempts to give it a second reading have been repeatedly blocked, despite it having the public backing of Andrej Babiš, the prime minister.\\n\\nCritics point out that Babiš has declined to use his authority to instruct MPs from his ANO party to vote for the bill and has sent out mixed signals by recently meeting with the rightwing group Movement for Life, which aims to increase birth rates and has been associated with homophobic stances.\\n\\nOpponents have tabled a counter-proposal to bring the Czech constitution into line with laws passed in Hungary and Slovakia that would explicitly define marriage as between a man and a woman. It is unlikely to pass but has received support from church figures and from Miloš Zeman, the populist Czech president, who has said he would veto any legislation legalising gay marriage.\\n\\n50 years after Stonewall: Yuval Noah Harari on the new threats to LGBT rights Read more\\n\\nAcross the region, the rhetoric has had an impact. A University of Warsaw study last year found more than two-thirds of people identifying as LGBTI in Poland had endured psychological or physical violence, and 70% of teenagers identifying as LGBTI had had suicidal thoughts. At a recent equality parade in the eastern Polish city of Białystok, far-right thugs physically assaulted participants after the event was publicly denounced by the local archbishop.\\n\\nThe increased homophobia has prompted solidarity and fightback among the LGBT community and more liberal-minded central Europeans. In Poland, a #jestemLGBT (I am LGBT) online campaign was launched on Twitter this year, with thousands of people celebrating their sexuality, coming out or simply showing their support.\\n\\nIn Hungary, parts of the LGBT community feel the new messaging requires a strong response. “The horrible homophobic communication somehow has woken up the community and made them realise that now they now have to fight for their rights,” said Kanicsár.\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi', \"In a 2016 study of Diepsloot, 56% of men surveyed admitted to raping or beating a women in the previous 12 months – a lack of policing is just the start of the problem\\n\\nThe violence usually starts on a Thursday night, worsens on a Friday and reaches a peak over Saturday into the early hours of the morning. At the start of spring in September, temperatures rise and tempers flare. By the hot, heady weeks of the festive season in December, domestic abuse reaches its worst, outdoing the incidents of violence that have become common over long weekends throughout the year. In Diepsloot, an impoverished community north west of Johannesburg, gender-based violence has become so common that it follows a recognisable pattern.\\n\\nSome would survive if a car comes by while they are raping her or before she was killed Brown Lekekela\\n\\nBrown Lekekela has barely taken a weekend or holiday off since starting the Green Door shelter in the heart of the community. It’s a safe space women can run to in the middle of the night – or sometimes in the middle of the day – if they are experiencing abuse from their partners.\\n\\n“There were incidents of women being killed on the street,” said Lekekela, who used to work as a volunteer at the local police station. “Some would survive if a car comes by while they are raping her or before she was killed.”\\n\\nLekekela heard a version of this story so many times that he started his own shelter, a halfway way house literally situated between the community and the police station. In a neighbourhood where the 3km walk to the police station can be deadly, the Green Door is not so much a doorway as a tall gate built into an even taller concrete wall – the kind South Africans refer to as a “stop nonsense.” Behind it, in Lekekela’s front yard, is a wooden shed with beds and basin; a safe place where women can report abuse.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brown Lekekela started his own shelter for women, the Green Door, behind secure fencing in a shed in his front yard. Photograph: Delwyn Verasamy/Mail & Guardian\\n\\nIn a country with high rates of gender-based violence, Diepsloot has come to represent the convergence of all the factors contributing to abuse against women. In 2016, a University of the Witwatersrand study sampling 2,600 local men found that 56% of them admitted to either raping or beating a woman in the previous 12 months. These sorts of statistics have made the neighbourhood a microcosm of South Africa’s social ills that lend themselves to high rates of gender violence. It has also attracted a slew of social science researchers, NGOs, and journalists – including one controversial BBC documentary – trying to find solutions to Diepsloot’s troubles.\\n\\nDiepsloot is in many ways representative of South Africa’s post-apartheid struggle. The settlement was founded in 1995, a year after South Africa became a democracy. It was meant to be a temporary shelter for about 200 families evicted from squatter camps in nearby Honeydew and other neighbourhoods. Then more evicted families arrived. Their settlement merged with another existing community on what was once farmland around northwest Johannesburg. Soon, migrants from around the country arrived, and then from around southern Africa. Today, Diepsloot has an estimated population of between 350,000 and 400,000 people, living in a district divided into 12 “extensions”.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lekekela set up the Green in response to the reports of violence he heard as a police volunteer. Photograph: Delwyn Verasamy/Mail & Guardian\\n\\nThe South African government began building more formal homes in 1999, but construction could not keep up with the demands of rapid urbanisation. As a consequence, Diepsloot is a mix of public housing block cottages, and shacks made of corrugated iron and plastic lining, residents reliant on outbuildings for sanitation. The few buildings that rise above a single storey include an evangelical church and a loan office. While the main road is paved, on the side streets tar gives way to gravel, ditches and stagnant water.\\n\\nRemnants of apartheid-era planning and the density of the areamean that the streets are a maze, lacking a formalised layout. An unreliable electricity grid means street lighting is unpredictable. The township is surrounded by open fields and farms, while the closest neighbourhoods are wealthy gated communities.\\n\\nThis geography makes it both easier for a perpetrator to evade police and potentially fatal for a woman trying to escape or report violence. The roads are too narrow for a police van, and officers are often too afraid to patrol on foot. If they take the risk and leave the car unattended, it is very likely to be vandalised.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest South African protesters march against gender-based violence in September 2019 following the rape and murder of UCT student Uyinene Mrwetyana in Cape Town. Photograph: Gallo Images/Gallo Images via Getty Images\\n\\n“It’s really a lack of perpetrator accountability that really allows crimes of all kind, but gender-based violence as well, to fester,” said Lindsay Henson, executive director of Lawyers Against Abuse. The NGO works out of a sweltering container in Diepsloot’s extension 2, sharing the lot with two other non-profits, a doctor’s surgery and a creche. On this particular day, the electricity in the area is out and the smell of sewage wafts in. Established in 2014, the organisation offers support to survivors of domestic abuse, sexual violence and child abuse.\\n\\nIn 2016 Diepsloot built a new police station costing an estimated 105 million rand (£5.5m). Standing at the head of Diepsloot’s main street, and arguably the tallest building in the area, its looming presence has made residents feel safer. The introduction of holding cells has made the threat of arrest more concrete, but has not quite solved the problem of on-the-ground policing. Survivors still have to accompany detectives to identify their abusers, meaning that reporting violence is still dangerous.\\n\\n'Only we can change things': life in the gang-ridden other side of Cape Town Read more\\n\\nThe factors contributing to the high rates of violence in Diepsloot are complex and run the psychosocial gamut, from poverty and unemployment to intergenerational violence and childhood trauma, explains Henderson. The particular geography of Diepsloot makes it difficult to protect survivors. The nearest public hospital is more than 30km away, the nearest court nearly 20km away.\\n\\nWhen unplanned urban communities spring up and mushroom in the way that Diepsloot has, providing basic services like policing is a constant game of catch-up. The murder rate in Diepsloot remains high, while sexual offences and contact crimes are on the increase. While this increase can at least partially be attributed to better rates of reporting crime, it shows that policing is not a panacea for South Africa’s high rates of gender-based violence.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

Just a few miles from town, the armoured SUV she was traveling in was ambushed by assailants who opened fire with automatic weapons and threw at least one grenade.\\n\\nGarcía, her mother and two others were killed. Her bodyguard was severely injured.\\n\\n“They couldn’t beat her with arguments, so they did it with grenades,” García’s father said in the living room of his house in the nearby city of Santander de Quilichao. “This is the price you pay for trying to do honest politics in Colombia.”\\n\\nGarcía was a candidate for the Liberal party, a broad church that – along with its rival Conservatives – dominated Colombian politics for most of the past century, until both gave way to insurgent new parties.\\n\\nHer death made her the seventh candidate to be murdered in advance of local elections this Sunday for governors, mayors, and city councillors across Colombia.\\n\\nThe string of political killings has shaken the country, reminding many of the wanton political violence of past decades, when thousands of candidates – including three presidential contenders – were killed on the campaign trail.\\n\\nA 2016 peace deal with the leftwing rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) was supposed to usher in a new chapter of tranquility, formally ending half a century of civil war that killed 260,000 and forced over 7 million from their homes.\\n\\nBut while the Farc demobilization removed one element from Colombia’s labyrinthine war – and a nationwide overarching narrative for the violence – peace never truly arrived: local conflicts over the drug trade, land rights and mineral resources continue to fuel violence.\\n\\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In her father’s home, photos of Karina García growing up show her love of horses and the countryside. Photograph: Joe Parkin Daniels\\n\\nAccording to Colombia’s human rights ombudsman, 486 activists and human rights defenders have been murdered since January 2016, most of them in rural areas like Suárez, where dissident rebel groups, local mafias and drug traffickers with paramilitary origins still jostle for strategic territory and economic and political power.\\n\\n“Suárez has always had its problems. Our Karina’s death is just the latest example,” said María del Pilar, a local social worker who knew the candidate. “Nothing changes around here,” she added, masking her pain.\\n\\nSuárez, with a population of 20,000, sits in the Andean mountains beside the fast-flowing River Cauca, from which the surrounding province takes its name.\\n\\nIt is a modest place, but the highlands which loom over the village contain great riches: fields of coca – the key ingredient in cocaine – and rich seams of gold.\\n\\nEfrain Ceron, the priest of the town’s Catholic parish, said the armed groups fighting for local control would not be swayed by any talk of peace. “There is simply too much money to be made in the hills,” he said.\\n\\nIn Suárez, the peace process may have actually poured fuel on the fire: the conflict had for decades deterred multinational mining companies from exploring the region’s gold deposits, leaving the mountain’s riches for local artisanal miners.\\n\\nBut since 2016, fears grew that outsiders would come for the gold. García’s political opponents seized on such concerns, and rumours began to spread that she planned to invite multinational corporations – and with them, paramilitary enforcers – to Suárez.\\n\\nHer murder was a tragedy of a death foretold. Just a week before she died, García posted a video on her Facebook page denying the rumours – and begging for an end to the whispering campaign against her.\\n\\nShe was incredibly brave and incredibly driven. Her death hit everyone in this town - not just her supporters Efrain Ceron\\n\\n“Please, for God’s sake, don’t act so irresponsibly,” she pleaded in the video. “This could be fatal.”\\n\\nToday, García still haunts the town. Her campaign posters still hang from walls and lampposts, but many are defaced, her image blacked out with spray paint.\\n\\nFor weeks after her death, the upbeat jingles of her ads still chimed on local radio; her campaign team had booked commercial space by the month.\\n\\nIn the days following her assassination, locals held a candle-lit procession and erected a shrine at her humble campaign headquarters on the town’s main square.\\n\\nUnlike many politicians across the country, García was widely liked in the community.\\n\\n“She was incredibly brave and incredibly driven,” said Ceron, the priest. “Her death hit everyone in this town - not just her supporters.”\\n\\nBelatedly, the military presence has been stepped up, with heavily armed soldiers in fatigues zipping up and down the steep streets on motorcycles.\\n\\nPresident Iván Duque convened his security council in the regional capital, Popayán, and swiftly put the blame on dissident Farc rebels – a minority of the group who have refused to disarm.\\n\\nDuque also blamed drug traffickers, working with “international cartels”, for the breakdown in public security in the region.

Show Hide Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\\'s cities remain hugely divided, both economically and racially. This week Guardian Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope. Africa correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town\\'s spectacular beaches and trendy cafes. Author Niq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the \"other Soweto\", one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see. We hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children. We explore the deadly underground world of zama zama gold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay by Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.

Class has complicated the region’s older racial binaries. “The rich area nearby is protected by a lot of security guards carrying guns. I tried to photograph there but was told to leave.”\\n\\nPhotographing in Daleside proved no less difficult at first.\\n\\nA gardener at home in Daleside. The previously white-dominated area is now more mixed\\n\\n“People still confused me for a garden worker.” Sobekwa’s camera was also a source of distrust. “There is heightened suspicion because of the killing of white farmers. They thought I might be a criminal.”\\n\\nSobekwa says it was easier to work when he was with his travel companion, French photographer Cyprien Clément-Delmas.\\n\\n“For me, when I’m with Clément-Delmas – my white, French, collaborator – it is easier to work there. But when I’m alone – when he goes back to France – it is a bit challenging for me. I have to constantly be careful how I approach people and their personal spaces.”\\n\\nA girl who wants to be a model sits on her bed in her room\\n\\nThe pair befriended a kindly pastor at a local church to help gain the trust of Daleside’s conservative white community.\\n\\nAmong the photos Sobekwa has produced for their work-in-progress book on Daleside are frank portraits of residents in their bedrooms. One shows an adolescent girl with ginger hair reclining on a bed with a pink crocheted bedspread. Pasted on the wall behind her are hand-drawn pictures and photos torn from magazines. “I was amazed to see posters of people she looked up to on the wall,” says Sobekwa. “This is what we do in the township.”\\n\\nInterior of one of the first houses in Daleside\\n\\nSobekwa met the girl’s family at the supermarket and he has often visited them. He has even been invited to stay over – a noticeably different attitude to that of some white families in the town who have refused to be photographed. There are no mixed-race couples in Daleside.\\n\\nBosman, Jorden and Naiden chilling outside the Burns’ house\\n\\n“Cyprien did some interviews with the white residents by himself,” says Sobekwa. “I was so surprised at what they told him. Most of them don’t like black people. They say black people have brought crime, drugs, all the bad things.”\\n\\nReligion is an important facet of life in this community. Christian icons are commonplace in its homes, says Sobekwa. For the photographer this is another point of overlap with life in South Africa’s black townships. He describes the inhabitants of Daleside as being in “the same trap as poor black people” – dependent on religion at a time of worsening income disparities and economic stagnation.\\n\\nMorne in his backyard with his dog\\n\\nSobekwa sees similarities between the challenges facing Daleside and the township of Thokoza where he grew up. “This helps me relate to them, to some extent,” he says, “but there are also differences that make it difficult for me. As an outsider, most of the time I was mistaken for someone who was looking for a job. This wouldn’t happen if I was there with Cyprien.\\n\\n“At times I’d also feel like I wasn’t connecting with them: for me it is important to connect with the people I photograph. I think it was because I kept being reminded that I did not belong there, even though I felt like I did because of those similarities I saw between our communities.”\\n\\n‘Garden boy’ in the middle-class area of Daleside\\n\\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter', 'A student draws a bull in the sand in Venta de Antequera.\\n\\nI began the project in 2016 after watching a TV programme in Poland about bullfighting schools in Spain. I can’t remember exactly what it was, but I was so surprised when I saw it: there were these young teenagers doing exercises in pairs, with one of them playing the bull and the other the bullfighter. It was just so striking and it made me realise that even bullfighters have to start somewhere. I’d never thought about it before and I found it really strange that these young boys already know they want to be bullfighters.\\n\\nThere was also something a little ridiculous when you look at them playing at being bulls and then compare that to the blood and everything else that comes to mind when we think about bullfighting. I think the initial idea for the project came from that contrast.\\n\\nI discovered that there were more than 20 bullfighting schools in Andalucía and I wrote to five or six of them. Only one answered but I was still surprised because I thought they would be wary and would prefer to keep their distance. The teacher who replied told me to come and see how things were for myself.\\n\\nTop: left, Francisco and Ivan, students of the bullfighting school in Écija, after classes; right, Francisco plays the part of the bull. Above: a former bullfighter, Jose, likes to come to the school in Écija to give advice to the apprentices.\\n\\nI had my own prejudices – at the beginning I thought it would be a way for me to learn about machismo and how it has developed. But when I arrived at the school in Écija for the first time in November 2016, it was all a surprise. One of the first things the teacher said to me was: “I understand you don’t like this; I understand that what we’re doing here must seem very strange to you. But we grow up with all this and it’s something completely normal for us.” He understood my point of view – or how people abroad see things.\\n\\nTop: Alejandro Cano signs pictures after a succesful fight in Villaluenga del Rosario. Above: a teacher from La Algaba prepares his pupils for entry into the arena\\n\\nThere were about 15 or 20 boys at the school. Most of them were teenagers but there was also one very focused six-year-old boy. Normally you have to be nine to start, but he was so driven and already knew what he wanted. I asked the teacher what such a small boy could understand about killing and death. He told me that these children don’t think about it all – they think about the myths of the great bullfighters and the atmosphere of the bullring and the striking traje de luces that a torero wears.\\n\\nIf you look at the TV, at newspapers and magazines, at postcards and paintings and signs, you can see how prevalent the bull is in Andalucía. The animals are ubiquitous, so it’s not surprising that kids and teenagers are exposed to all that culture and folklore.\\n\\nTop: young spectators in the arena in Osuna. Many are brought by their parents and grandparents. Centre: left, a young bullfighter, Adrián Centenera Peréz, after the fight in Osuna; right, Asier Ruiz de la Hermosa, from the bullfighting school in Guadalajara, in the bullring of La Algaba. In 2017 he killed his first calf. Right: most of the bullfighters are Catholics. They pray before the fight and sometimes take religious items with them into the arena.\\n\\nWhat’s more, there are some events and fiestas that are free or very cheap, because they have a promotional goal and they are organised usually in smaller towns. That makes this culture accessible. But the other thing I realised during the project was that for a lot of them, it’s an intergenerational bond. Many are brought to the school by their grandfathers, but they also watch bullfights on TV together and go to bullfights in small towns. It’s a really strong connection between the generations. If you really love your grandfather and he’s an aficionado, it’s really normal for you to want to please him by getting involved\\n\\nAbove: a lesson in the bullfighting school in Venta de Antequera, Seville. Boys do most of the exercises in pairs – one of them plays the role of torero and the other the role of the bull. Right: Salón de Carteles, the Hall of Posters, in Maestranza Bullring, Seville\\n\\nI asked the boys what their favourite films were and they said they liked watching old bullfighting movies from the 1950s and 60s. There’s an element of nostalgia in all of it. You’ve got that old myth about brave young men using bullfighting as a means to work their way out of poverty and become stars. It was almost like a Spanish version of the American dream. But bullfighters back then were also so close to death that they knew how to live – and live well – when it came to women and artistic adoration and fame. I think that and the nostalgia explain some of the appeal for kids today.\\n\\nA class in Venta de Antequera in Seville.\\n\\nLeft: David is one of the youngest pupils at the school in Écija; Yeray holds aloft one of the gold and magenta capes\\n\\nWhen I saw the kids training, I was struck by how nice they were and how disciplined. At first I thought I was going to do some kind of critique of it all, but I didn’t want to use the kids in that way because it’s just the world in which they happen to have grown up. I also came to realise that it wasn’t all about machismo. In a certain way, it’s not just about the killing either. It’s a really special atmosphere. I wanted to show that these aren’t cruel, aggressive, evil kids – which is how people in Poland usually see them.\\n\\nI didn’t want to focus on the actual bullfights and how they fight the animals because those are images everyone’s already seen. For me, it’s not about the act of killing, it’s about the story behind it all: why does this tradition endure and why do these young guys follow it? That’s what I wanted to understand. I realised I couldn’t judge it all. If I judged it, I wouldn’t be able to carry on with the project. It’s just about trying to understand it.', 'Students protesting against rising transport costs hold signs written in Spanish saying: ‘We pay cops’ salaries and subway fares, and here they are against us,’ ‘Save on your ticket’ and ‘The people united will never be defeated’\\n\\nPhotograph: Esteban Félix/AP', 'Lemur species vary enormously in their size, appearance and behaviour, from the strange-looking nocturnal aye-aye to the sideways-leaping Coquerel’s sifaka. All species are endemic to the island of Madagascar, where they are under severe threat from fragmentation and loss of their forest habitat, due to logging, subsistence agriculture and forest fires, and are also at risk from hunting and the rapid recent increase in the human population.\\n\\nCrowned lemur\\n\\nCrowned lemurs are classified as endangered and are found only in the far north of Madagascar, making them susceptible to extinction. They get their name from the bright orange crown pattern that males and females have on top of their heads.\\n\\nCoquerel’s sifaka\\n\\nOne of the most unusual-looking primates, Coquerel’s sifakas are leaf-eaters from the dry north-western forests of Madagascar. Sifakas are perhaps best known for their unique upright, leaping run, using their back legs to propel themselves along the ground or to leap up to 20 feet from one tree to the next.\\n\\nSahamalaza sportive lemur\\n\\nVery little is known about this critically endangered species and it is not kept in any zoo, but researchers from Bristol Zoological Society and the universities of Bristol and Turin found that it uses the alarm calls of birds and other lemurs to detect the presence of predators. These lemurs roost during the day, often in exposed locations such as tree holes, and therefore risk falling victim to predators from the air and the ground.\\n\\nThe aye-aye is the largest nocturnal primate, easily recognisable for its unusual appearance – a long, thin middle finger, continuously growing fused teeth, yellow eyes, big ears and a long, bushy tail. Their major threats are forest degradation and fragmentation, slash-and-burn subsistence agriculture and local communities that believe the aye-aye is an evil omen and often kill them when they are near their villages. Exact numbers remaining in the wild are unknown but aye-ayes are rare. Bristol Zoo Gardens has a breeding group in its nocturnal house.\\n\\nRing-tailed lemur\\n\\nRing-tailed lemurs are classified as endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species. In the wild, they are only found in the dry forests and bush of southern Madagascar. The wild population is declining and most live in small fragmented forests. Habitat destruction is the biggest threat to the survival of all lemur species.\\n\\nRed-bellied lemur\\n\\nThe red-bellied lemur is classified as vulnerable in the wild. The main threat that they face is habitat loss, with almost 90% of the eastern rainforest of Madagascar being destroyed since humans have lived on the island, mainly by slash-and-burn subsistence farming, logging and mining. In some areas there is also the threat of hunting.\\n\\nBlue-eyed black lemur\\n\\nThe blue-eyed black lemur (or Sclater’s lemur) is classified as critically endangered, due to hunting and habitat loss. There are thought to be just a few thousand left. These lemurs all have striking blue eyes, but males and females look very different; males are completely black, while females have a reddish-brown coat. Bristol Zoological Society works with local Malagasy organisations to protect these animals in the wild.\\n\\nBlack-and-white ruffed lemur\\n\\nThe black-and-white ruffed lemur is the largest of the true lemur family (Lemuridae) and is listed as critically endangered. The population is thought to have declined by 80% over the last 21 years, primarily due to continuing decline in extent and quality of habitat from deforestation and commercial agriculture, logging and mining, as well as hunting. This lemur lives in female-dominated groups with a complex social structure and is known for its loud, raucous calls.\\n\\nLake Alaotra gentle lemur\\n\\nThe Lake Alaotra gentle lemur is the only primate that lives exclusively in wetlands. Despite legal protection efforts, the population has been declining continuously since the first published census in the 1990s. They now number about 2,500 individuals, due to poaching and annual marshland burning. Reconnecting isolated subpopulations is a priority conservation measure.\\n\\nIndri\\n\\nThis highly distinctive black-and-white animal is the only lemur that communicates through long, complex songs, including a group chorus. Numbers are declining due to habitat destruction for slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and fuelwood gathering, all in protected areas. Illegal hunting is also a major threat, despite the traditional tribal taboos that used to protect them; in some villages, the skins are worn as clothing and the meat fetches a premium price.\\n\\nSambirano mouse lemur\\n\\nThe Sambirano mouse lemur is one of the smallest primates in the world and is only found at a few sites in the north-west of Madagascar. We know very little about this species, but it seems to prefer to live in secondary forest, trees along water courses and the forest edge. It is believed this is because the vegetation in these locations is denser and offers more places for these tiny animals to hide.', 'Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Denis Thorpe/The Guardian\\n\\nA family picks its way through a flood during monsoon season in India, where the Guardian photographer Denis Thorpe was sent in 1977 on assignment for the foreign desk.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz\\n\\nBy October, with the IPO abandoned and his office-space sharing company bleeding cash, Neumann found himself late on a Sunday evening pleading with WeWork’s largest lender for a $5 billion lifeline, people familiar with the matter said. The message was clear - without new financing WeWork would run out of money within weeks.\\n\\n“Do you still believe in the company?” Neumann, who had stepped down as CEO but was still WeWork’s chairman, asked a room of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPN.N) bankers on the 42nd floor of their midtown Manhattan headquarters on Oct. 6, the sources said.\\n\\nThe JPMorgan bankers, led by asset and wealth management CEO Mary Erdoes and debt capital markets head Jim Casey, told Neumann and other WeWork directors they would back the company, and were confident they could raise the money. But they would not underwrite the deal on the spot, as one board member requested.\\n\\nWith questions swirling around WeWork’s chances of survival in the wake of its failed IPO, the bankers told Neumann they needed some time to sound out investors first, according to the sources.\\n\\nA few days later, an alternative rescue plan began to emerge from WeWork’s largest shareholder, Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T).\\n\\nBoth were far from perfect. But given its dire straits, WeWork was fortunate to have a choice.\\n\\nThis account of how WeWork’s financial rescue came together over the past three weeks is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the negotiations. They requested anonymity to discuss the confidential deliberations.\\n\\nWeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment for this story.\\n\\nRequests for an interview with Neumann were also declined.\\n\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROBLEM\\n\\nSoftBank offered $9.5 billion to WeWork, including new debt and recommitted equity, as well as a tender offer to partly cash out Neumann and other shareholders.\\n\\nIn addition to providing more funds than JPMorgan, the SoftBank deal resolved what some WeWork directors privately referred to as the company’s “corporate governance problem” - Neumann’s controlling grip.\\n\\nSoftBank’s deal would strip Neumann’s voting power and remove him from the board. Neumann was blamed by other WeWork investors such as Benchmark Capital and China’s Hony Capital, for the company’s precipitous decline, some of the people said.\\n\\nHis erratic management style, combined with WeWork’s lack of a clear path to profitability, alienated potential IPO investors.\\n\\nThe problem was that Neumann could still wield power over the company even after he quit as CEO on Sept. 24 because, as WeWork’s founder, each of his shares had 10 voting rights. Others had only one vote for every share.\\n\\nIt was clear to SoftBank, as well as to a special board committee formed to consider the financing plans, that Neumann relinquishing control would come with a price tag, three of the people said.\\n\\nCLAURE AND NEUMANN NEGOTIATE\\n\\nIn meetings in New York between Neumann and SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, the contours of a side deal came together. SoftBank would provide a $500 million credit line to refinance Neumann’s personal borrowings made against WeWork’s stock, as long as he used proceeds from cashing out up to $970 million of his shares to repay SoftBank for that loan first.\\n\\nSoftBank’s latest offer valued the company at as little as $5.9 billion based on the repricing of warrants it was already committed to exercise, according to Bernstein research, a far cry from the $47 billion it had assigned to WeWork in January.\\n\\nNeumann’s special pay-off did not stop there. He negotiated with SoftBank a four-year non-compete agreement with a $185 million “consulting fee” in return for stepping down from WeWork’s board. He would now only get to observe board proceedings instead of participating.\\n\\nWeWork’s special board committee members expressed concern that Neumann’s bailout would cause outrage among many WeWork employees whose stock options had a much higher strike price than the valuation in SoftBank’s tender offer, some of the people said.\\n\\nThe committee declined to comment for this article.\\n\\nSoftBank’s offer to buy up to $3 billion of WeWork stock from employees and existing shareholders would value the company at about $8 billion, higher than the new valuation based on the warrants.\\n\\nNeumann attempted to push up the valuation of the tender offer in his negotiations with SoftBank, one of the people said.\\n\\nSoftBank stood firm. Anticipating criticism from its own shareholders for possibly throwing good money after bad, it wasn’t prepared to pay more.\\n\\nMost WeWork directors wanted Neumann off the board, and many minority shareholders, which the special committee was formed to represent, wanted to cash out, the people said.\\n\\nJPMorgan had not pursued raising additional money for shareholders, in part because WeWork only tasked the bank with delivering $5 billion of debt financing.\\n\\nJPMORGAN’S COVENANT\\n\\nWhen the bank submitted the debt package on Monday, only private equity firm Starwood Capital Group, run by real estate mogul Barry Sternlicht, had committed to join JPMorgan in sharing the financing burden.\\n\\nJPMorgan agreed to provide the rest and transfer the money by Thursday. But the deal also included a condition, known as a covenant, that would trigger a debt default if SoftBank did not make good on $1.5 billion that it had already committed to provide when warrants came due next April, the people said.\\n\\nJPMorgan wanted to ensure SoftBank would honor its financial commitment, which would lessen the risk for investors holding debt that would one day need to be repaid.\\n\\nBut SoftBank told WeWork’s board that it would not pay the $1.5 billion if its financing offer was rejected, two of the people added.\\n\\nThe problem from SoftBank’s perspective was that those warrants were based on January’s $47 billion valuation of WeWork. It wanted to change the pricing radically to reflect WeWork’s dramatic fall in value.\\n\\nJPMorgan dealmakers, on the other hand, believed WeWork’s contract with SoftBank prevented the telecommunications and technology giant from reneging on that earlier commitment, other people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\nIn the end, the risk that SoftBank wouldn’t fulfill its commitment if the JPMorgan financing package was chosen helped swing the special committee’s deliberations in favor of SoftBank’s offer, they added.\\n\\nSoftBank had made WeWork an offer it had to accept.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, SoftBank unveiled a deal that increased its ownership of WeWork to 80% from 30%, but sought to avoid having to consolidate WeWork’s liabilities on its balance sheet by not taking full control of the expanded board. SoftBank will only have 5 of the 10 seats.\\n\\nBut unless SoftBank can turn WeWork around quickly, it could be a pyrrhic victory.\\n\\nSlideshow (2 Images)\\n\\nWeWork has burned through almost $2.5 billion of cash since the end of June, and Claure will have to cut costs quickly, including slashing thousands of jobs and helping the company to find a way to get out of expensive leases. Otherwise, the new cash injection may not last long enough to stabilize the business.\\n\\nAs predicted, Claure is also facing some staff anger over the size of Neumann’s payout. He told employees on Wednesday that it was the “price” that had to be paid to get rid of Neumann’s voting rights. Otherwise, he said, “Adam could do whatever he wanted.”\\n\\n(The story corrects Erdoes’ job description in paragraph 4.)', 'LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Friday but were on track for strong weekly gains as support from a surprise draw in U.S. inventories and possible action from OPEC and its allies to extend output cuts outweighed broader economic concerns.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Pump jacks operate at sunset in Midland, Texas, U.S. February 11, 2019.

So what next?\\n\\nA disorderly Halloween Brexit looks unlikely. As to the outcome of an election, if there is one — anyone’s guess. Polls suggest Labour are lagging Johnson’s Tories but these have proved unreliable in the past. So, what we will get for sure is Brextension and also possibly an election.

You can see it in the CME’s FedWatch tool, where odds of a cut in the fed funds target rate to 1.50-1.75% are at 94%. That’s up from about 84% a week ago and 64% a month ago.\\n\\nThe expectations are also apparent in the yield curve, where the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries has widened to around 18 basis points. It was below 4 bps just after the Fed’s last rate cut. That slice of the curve inverted in August, sparking fears of a U.S recession that would force the Fed to join the negative rate situation of other developed economies.\\n\\nThe 3-month/10-year yield curve too has turned positive after being inverted for the most part of six months. That’s down to a fall in shorter-dated yields, reflecting confidence the Fed has at least one more cut up its sleeve.\\n\\nWhat next though?\\n\\nClues may lie in U.S. company earnings. As we near the half-way mark for the Q3 season, we’ve seen more upside surprises than misses from S&P 500 companies. That’s giving investors a reason to be optimistic about the business cycle.

Such messaging would indicate the super-easy policy bias will be extended until possibly end-2020.\\n\\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda says the BOJ could “certainly” cut rates further and analysts reckon a move to -0.2% or even -0.3% are possible from the current -0.1%. But no one is quite sure what it would take to make that cut.\\n\\nExport-reliant Japan is already smarting from the trade war and slowing global demand. A higher sales tax rate has just kicked in. And Japanese banks are feeling the pain of a flat yield curve that keeps even 10-year yields negative. But given the BOJ isn’t given to shock and awe, there’s palpably more excitement over Tokyo’s tiffs with the International Olympic Committee on the schedule for road athletics than next week’s policy meeting.

No surprise analysts have been downgrading earnings estimates for 19 straight months. Little joy is expected in Q3.\\n\\nBut — and there is a but.\\n\\nWith the Brexit fog starting to dissipate and so much growth gloom already priced in, it might just be time for investors to turn a blind eye to bank margins and focus on the positives. And banks will benefit, albeit only slightly, from tiered ECB rates that should offer a small reprieve from penalty charges they pay on idle cash.\\n\\nMoreover, bank shares are cheap, carry dividend yields close to 6% and are this year’s worst performing European sector.

Costs rose because of higher aluminium and malt barley costs, and due to the weaker currencies of some of its markets, notably the Brazilian real.\\n\\nSales and marketing costs were also higher than in the third quarter of 2018. Last year, such costs were skewed towards the first half of the year because of the soccer World Cup.\\n\\n“Whilst the third quarter has a number of timing issues on the cost side, it is uncharacteristic of ABI to miss on margins,” said Jefferies analyst Edward Mundy.\\n\\nThe results suggest full-year organic EBITDA growth of about 4-5%, compared with current consensus of 7%, he said.\\n\\nAnheuser-Busch InBev and beer companies - here\\n\\nBRAZIL AND SOUTH KOREA\\n\\nBeyond these anticipated items, the company also suffered lower sales in Brazil and Korea as it increased prices in weak markets.\\n\\nIn Brazil, AB InBev’s second-largest market behind the United States, it saw volume drop by 3% as some competitors sold their beer at a discount to consumers, who have been feeling pressure on their disposable income.\\n\\nBrazil’s economic performance has been erratic, reporting a contraction in the first quarter. The central bank has raised its growth forecast for 2019 to 0.9% but cited a high degree of uncertainty.\\n\\nIn South Korea, where AB InBev is market leader, it hiked prices in April, but rolled them back this month because of an economic slowdown and after rivals failed to follow suit.\\n\\nSouth Korea’s trade-reliant economy has been among those worst hit by cooling demand as a prolonged U.S.-China tariff war disrupts global supply chains. Its economic growth slowed more than expected in the third quarter.\\n\\nAB InBev said it still expected strong overall revenue growth in 2019 but challenges in Brazil and South Korea would continue into the fourth quarter, so the company only expected “moderate” growth in core profit.\\n\\nEconomic challenges in other markets, including Argentina and South Africa, also led the company to push more affordable lagers, meaning revenue per litre growth would be slightly behind inflation. It previously forecast above-inflation growth.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Anheuser-Busch InBev is pictured outside the brewer's headquarters in Leuven, Belgium February 28, 2019.

Jakarta tower issues takeoff clearance and the plane leaves the runway at 6:20:33 a.m.\\n\\nTwo seconds later, the stick shaker or stall alarm starts vibrating on the left side where the captain sits. A faulty Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor is feeding false data to a flight computer, which thinks the plane is in danger of losing lift.\\n\\nThe captain is recorded as “exclaiming about what happened to the aircraft”, while the co-pilot tells him there is also a problem of inconsistent airspeed readings.\\n\\nThe co-pilot makes a similar exclamation and asks the captain, who does not respond, if he wants to return.\\n\\nAn air traffic controller clears the pilots to climb to 27,000 feet. Now the cockpit’s altitude readings are described as inconsistent.\\n\\nThe co-pilot asks air traffic control for the reading on the radar display and is told they’re at 900 feet as the aircraft was climbing.\\n\\nThe co-pilot is asked by the captain to run a memory checklist, the most urgent type of problem-solving procedure which pilots must know by heart, for unreliable airspeed values. There is no record in the transcript of him doing this.\\n\\nUnsure what altitude to request from controllers, he is told by the captain to “request uuh..proceed”.\\n\\nAsked by air traffic control to describe the problem, the co-pilot replies they’re experiencing “flight control problems”.\\n\\nMEMORY ITEM\\n\\nThe captain briefly hands control to the co-pilot, while air control warns the flight has descended to “ONE SEVEN HUNDRED” (1,700 feet) and asks for the intended altitude.\\n\\nThe captain requests 5,000 feet, which the co-pilot radios to control.\\n\\nThe controller instructs the pilots to climb and turn northeast. An automated cockpit voice alert warns the crew to watch the bank, or turning angle.\\n\\nThe captain again calls for a “memory item”, but does not say which mental checklist he is referring to. Asked to explain, he replies, “check”.\\n\\nSeventeen seconds later the co-pilot warns “flight control,” to which the captain responds “yeah”.\\n\\nJust after three minutes into the fight, and again later, the sound of pages being turned is picked up on the cockpit recording followed by the sound of the trim wheel - a manual override linked to the trim system controlled by MCAS.\\n\\nThe transcript suggests growing stress and more fragmented communications, coupled with confusion about which checklist to use.\\n\\nThe co-pilot searches increasingly frantically for an unreliable airspeed checklist - “Where is the?....no airspeed,” and moments later, “Airspeed, airspeed” followed by more pages.\\n\\nThe captain asks a flight attendant to call the off-duty engineer who is traveling on the plane. The microphone picks up repeated chimes signaling calls between flight attendants.\\n\\nThe door opens and the captain is heard asking someone to look at what is happening with the computer, whose MCAS software - which the report confirms was not included in the manuals -continues to push the nose down using the plane’s trim system.\\n\\n“OK, we are already gear up 5,000,” advises the co-pilot. A sound similar to an altitude alert rings out. “Fly up,” the co-pilot urges the captain.\\n\\nControllers ask the pilots whether the aircraft is descending, and the captain says “we have some problem”. It is not clear whether he says this on the radio or to his colleague.\\n\\nThe co-pilot tells controllers they are flying manually due to the flight control problem.\\n\\nAir traffic control instructs the pilots to prepare for landing at one of the runways.\\n\\nThe captain hands control of the plane to the co-pilot and contacts air control using the wrong flight number in a further sign of the gathering stress in the cockpit.\\n\\nHe warns air control that the altitude cannot be determined due to all the instruments showing different readings.\\n\\nControllers ask what altitude the pilots want, as the first officer is heard exclaiming that the aircraft is flying down.\\n\\nThe captain responds “FIVE THOU” (5,000 feet) and replies “It’s OK” as the co-pilot again exclaims the jet is descending.\\n\\nAn excess speed warning sounds.\\n\\nThe co-pilot says “fly up”.\\n\\nTwo computerized voice alerts - “TERRAIN, TERRAIN” followed by “SINK RATE” - blare out.\\n\\nThey are the final sounds included in the transcript before the 737 MAX hits the water at high speed, killing all 189 people on board.\\n\\nEleven minutes and 22 seconds after take-off, the recording stops.', \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials will discuss plans on Friday for China to buy more U.S. farm products, but in return, Beijing will request cancellation of some planned and existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, people briefed on the talks told Reuters.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump poses for a photo with China's President Xi Jinping before their bilateral meeting during the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 29, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\\n\\nRobert Lighthizer, the United States Trade Representative, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will speak by telephone Friday, their latest attempt to calm a nearly 16-month trade war that is roiling financial markets, disrupting supply chains and slowing global economic growth.\\n\\nThe two sides are working to try to agree on a text for a “Phase 1” trade agreement announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 11, in time for him to sign it with China’s President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\\n\\nSo far, Trump has only agreed to cancel an Oct. 15 increase in tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods as part of understandings reached on agricultural purchases, increased access to China’s financial services markets, improved protections for intellectual property rights and a currency pact.\\n\\nBut to seal the deal, Beijing is expected to ask Washington to drop its plan to impose tariffs on $156 billion worth of Chinese goods, including cell phones, laptop computers and toys, on Dec. 15, two U.S.-based sources told Reuters.\\n\\nBeijing also is likely to seek removal of 15% tariffs imposed on Sept. 1 on about $125 billion of Chinese goods, one of the sources said. Trump imposed the tariffs in August after a failed round of talks, effectively setting up punitive duties on nearly all of the $550 billion in U.S. imports from China.\\n\\n“The Chinese want to get back to tariffs on just the original $250 billion in goods,” the source said.\\n\\nDerek Scissors, a resident scholar and China expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said the original goal of the early October talks was to finalize a text on intellectual property, agriculture and market access to pave the way for a postponement of the Dec. 15 tariffs.\\n\\n“It’s odd that (the president) was so upbeat with Liu He and yet we still don’t have the Dec. 15 tariffs taken off the table,” Scissors said.\\n\\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week said no decisions were made about the Dec. 15 tariffs, but added: “We’ll address that as we continue to have conversations.”\\n\\nSMALLER PURCHASES?\\n\\nIf a text can be sealed, Beijing in return would exempt some U.S. agricultural products from tariffs, including soybeans and wheat and corn, a China-based source told Reuters. Buyers would be exempt from extra tariffs for future buying and get returns for tariffs they already paid in previous purchases of the products on the list.\\n\\nBut the ultimate amounts of China’s purchases are uncertain. Trump has touted purchases of $40-50 billion annually — far above China’s 2017 purchases of $19.5 billion as measured by the American Farm Bureau.\\n\\nOne of the sources briefed on the talks said that China’s offer would start out at around $20 billion in annual purchases, largely restoring the pre-trade-war status quo, but this could rise over time. Purchases also would depend on market conditions and pricing.\\n\\nLighthizer has emphasized China’s agreement to remove some restrictions on U.S. genetically modified crops and other food safety barriers, which the sources said is significant because it could pave the way for much higher U.S. farm exports to China.\\n\\nThe high-level call comes a day after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence railed against China’s trade practices and construction of a “surveillance state” in a major policy speech. But Pence left the door open to a trade deal with China, saying Trump wanted a “constructive” relationship with China.\\n\\nWhile the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods has brought China to the negotiating table to address U.S. grievances over its trade practices and intellectual property practices, they have so far failed to lead to significant change in China’s state-led economic model.\\n\\nThe “Phase 1” deal will ease tensions and provide some market stability, but is expected to do little to deal with core U.S. complaints about Chinese theft and forced transfer of American intellectual property and technology. The intellectual property rights chapter in the agreement largely deals with copyright and trademark issues and pledges to curb technology transfers that Beijing has already put into a new investment law, people familiar with the discussions said.\\n\\nSlideshow (2 Images)\\n\\nMore difficult issues, including data restrictions, China’s cybersecurity regulations and industrial subsidies will be left for later phases of talks, but some China trade watchers said that a completion of a Phase 1 deal could leave little incentive for China to negotiate further, especially in a U.S. election year in 2020.\\n\\n“US-China talks change very quickly from hot to cold but, the longer it takes to nail down the easy phase 1, the harder it is to imagine a phase 2 breakthrough,” said Scissors.\\n\\nTwo of the sources said that Mnuchin and Lighthizer would likely travel to Beijing the week of Nov. 3 for further in-person talks to try to finalize a text.

REUTERS/Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen/File Photo\\n\\nEU regulators were caught off guard last year by revelations of one of the largest ever money-laundering scandals, involving some 200 billion euros ($222.3 billion) in suspicious payments made between 2007 and 2015 through Danske Bank’s (DANSKE.CO) tiny Estonian branch.\\n\\nWhen the Danske scandal emerged in September 2018 in the wake of other smaller cases around the continent, the EU had just adopted the fifth revision of its anti money-laundering rules. But, watered down by conflicting interests among its 28 states, the overhaul quickly appeared insufficient.\\n\\nNow the EU Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, is being urged to quickly assess any restrictions stemming from existing legislation and present proposals to address shortfalls, an EU draft document seen by Reuters said.\\n\\nThe text was prepared by the Finnish presidency of the EU after the bloc’s finance ministers debated the matter at a meeting earlier in October.\\n\\nThe draft text says the Commission should consider the transfer of money-laundering supervisory powers to an EU agency and proposes a mechanism to coordinate national investigators.\\n\\nDespite criminal organizations frequently laundering the proceeds of their illegal activities abroad, the fight against financial crime is mostly dealt with by national authorities, which do not always fully cooperate.\\n\\nThe European Central Bank and the EU Parliament have said a body with EU-wide oversight powers could address this shortcoming.\\n\\nThe Finnish text is expected to be adopted at a Council meeting of EU finance ministers in December, but it is subject to changes. “There are still many discussions to be had before it is adopted,” an EU official said.\\n\\nMany governments have long opposed changes to the supervision of financial crime, fearing they would be forced to share sensitive information.\\n\\nYet supporters of tighter rules were positive. “For the first time, the Council supports the requests of the European Parliament to establish a truly European approach for combating financial crime,” said EU lawmaker Sven Giegold, the Greens’ leading deputy on financial matters.\\n\\nThe draft document also calls for a closer alignment of existing and future rules to reduce states’ discretionary powers in applying them.\\n\\nGovernments are currently free to independently set fines for wrongdoers, in some cases at very low levels, and keep them secret despite guidelines recommending the contrary.', 'Meet Citi’s Jane Fraser, Who May Become the First Woman to Run a Wall Street Bank', 'Nike and Adidas Are Caught Between China and the NBA.
